<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">OUTLINE OF THE HISTORY OF THE FRENCH INTELLECT FROM THE
MIDDLE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY TO THE ACCESSION TO
POWER OF LOUIS XIV.</div>

<p>The consideration of these great changes in the English
mind, has led me into a digression, which, so far from
being foreign to the design of this Introduction, is absolutely
necessary for a right understanding of it. In this,
as in many other respects, there is a marked analogy between
investigations concerning the structure of society
and investigations concerning the human body. Thus,
it has been found, that the best way of arriving at a
theory of disease is by beginning with the theory of
health; and that the foundation of all sound pathology
must be first sought in an observation, not of the abnormal,
but of the normal functions of life. Just in the
same way, it will, I believe, be found, that the best
method of arriving at great social truths, is by first
investigating those cases in which society has developed
itself according to its own laws, and in which the
governing powers have least opposed themselves to the
spirit of their times.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is on this account that, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
order to understand the position of France, I have
begun by examining the position of England. In order
to understand the way in which the diseases of the
first country were aggravated by the quackery of ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
rulers, it was necessary to understand the way in
which the health of the second country was preserved
by being subjected to smaller interference, and allowed
with greater liberty to continue its natural march.
With the light, therefore, which we have acquired by
a study of the normal condition of the English mind,
we can, with the greater ease, now apply our principles
to that abnormal condition of French society, by
the operations of which, at the close of the eighteenth
century, some of the dearest interests of civilization
were imperilled.</p>

<p>In France, a long train of events, which I shall hereafter
relate, had, from an early period, given to the
clergy a share of power larger than that which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
possessed in England. The results of this were for a
time decidedly beneficial, inasmuch as the church restrained
the lawlessness of a barbarous age, and secured
a refuge for the weak and oppressed. But as the French
advanced in knowledge, the spiritual authority, which
had done so much to curb their passions, began to press
heavily upon their genius, and impede its movements.
That same ecclesiastical power, which to an ignorant
age is an unmixed benefit, is to a more enlightened
age a serious evil. The proof of this was soon apparent.
For when the Reformation broke out, the
church had in England been so weakened, that it fell
almost at the first assault; its revenues were seized by
the crown,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and its offices, after being greatly diminished
both in authority and in wealth, were bestowed
upon new men, who, from the uncertainty of their
tenure, and the novelty of their doctrines, lacked that
long-established prescription by which the claims of
the profession are mainly supported. This, as we have
already seen, was the beginning of an uninterrupted
progress, in which, at every successive step, the ecclesiastical
spirit lost some of its influence. In France, on
the other hand, the clergy were so powerful, that they
were able to withstand the Reformation, and thus preserve
for themselves those exclusive privileges which
their English brethren vainly attempted to retain.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of that second marked divergence
between French and English civilization,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which
had its origin, indeed, at a much earlier period, but
which now first produced conspicuous results. Both
countries had, in their infancy, been greatly benefited
by the church, which always showed itself ready to
protect the people against the oppressions of the crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and the nobles.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But in both countries, as society advanced,
there arose a capacity for self-protection; and
early in the sixteenth, or probably even in the fifteenth
century, it became urgently necessary to diminish that
spiritual authority, which, by prejudging the opinions
of men, has impeded the march of their knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
It is on this account that Protestantism, so far from
being, as its enemies have called it, an aberration
arising from accidental causes, was essentially a normal
movement, and was the legitimate expression of the
wants of the European intellect. Indeed, the Reformation
owed its success, not to a desire of purifying the
church, but to a desire of lightening its pressure; and
it may be broadly stated, that it was adopted in every
civilized country, except in those where preceding
events had increased the influence of the ecclesiastical
order, either among the people or among their rulers.
This was, unhappily, the case with France, where the
clergy not only triumphed over the Protestants, but
appeared, for a time, to have gained fresh authority by
the defeat of such dangerous enemies.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The consequence of all this was, that in France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
every thing assumed a more theological aspect than in
England. In our country, the ecclesiastical spirit had,
by the middle of the sixteenth century, become so
feeble, that even intelligent foreigners were struck by
the peculiarity.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The same nation, which, during the
Crusades, had sacrificed innumerable lives in the hope
of planting the Christian standard in the heart of Asia,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
was now almost indifferent to the religion even of its
own sovereign. Henry VIII., by his sole will, regulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the national creed, and fixed the formularies of
the church, which, if the people had been in earnest,
he could not possibly have done; for he had no means
of compelling submission; he had no standing army;
and even his personal guards were so scanty, that
at any moment they could have been destroyed by a
rising of the warlike apprentices of London.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> After
his death, there came Edward, who, as a Protestant
king, undid the work of his father; and, a few years
later, there came Mary, who, as a Popish queen, undid
the work of her brother; while she, in her turn, was
succeeded by Elizabeth, under whom another great
alteration was effected in the established faith.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Such
was the indifference of the people, that these vast
changes were accompanied without any serious risk.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
In France, on the other hand, at the mere name of religion,
thousands of men were ready for the field. In
England, our civil wars have all been secular; they
have been waged, either for a change of dynasty, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
for an increase of liberty. But those far more horrible
wars, by which, in the sixteenth century, France was
desolated, were conducted in the name of Christianity,
and even the political struggles of the great families
were merged in a deadly contest between Catholics and
Protestants.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The effect this difference produced on the intellect of
the two countries is very obvious. The English, concentrating
their abilities upon great secular matters,
had, by the close of the sixteenth century, produced a
literature which never can perish. But the French,
down to that period, had not put forth a single work,
the destruction of which would now be a loss to Europe.
What makes this contrast the more remarkable is, that
in France the civilization, such as it was, had a longer
standing; the material resources of the country had
been earlier developed; its geographical position made
it the centre of European thought;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and it had possessed
a literature at a time when our ancestors were
a mere tribe of wild and ignorant barbarians.</p>

<p>The simple fact is, that this is one of those innumerable
instances which teach us that no country can rise
to eminence so long as the ecclesiastical power possesses
much authority. For, the predominance of the
spiritual classes is necessarily accompanied by a corresponding
predominance of the topics in which those
classes delight. Whenever the ecclesiastical profession
is very influential, ecclesiastical literature will be very
abundant, and what is called profane literature will be
very scanty. Hence it occurred, that the minds of the
French, being almost entirely occupied with religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
disputes, had no leisure for those great inquiries into
which we in England were beginning to enter;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and
there was, as we shall presently see, an interval of a
whole generation between the progress of the French
and English intellects, simply because there was about
the same interval between the progress of their scepticism.
The theological literature, indeed, rapidly increased;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
but it was not until the seventeenth century
that France produced that great secular literature, the
counterpart of which was to be found in England before
the sixteenth century had come to a close.</p>

<p>Such was, in France, the natural consequence of the
power of the church being prolonged beyond the period
which the exigencies of society required. But while
this was the intellectual result, the moral and physical
results were still more serious. While the minds of
men were thus heated by religious strife, it would have
been idle to expect any of those maxims of charity to
which theological faction is always a stranger. While
the Protestants were murdering the Catholics,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and
the Catholics murdering the Protestants, it was hardly
likely that either sect should feel tolerance for the
opinions of its enemy.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> During the sixteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
treaties were occasionally made between the two parties;
but they were only made to be immediately broken;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
and, with the single exception of l'Hôpital, the bare
idea of toleration does not seem to have entered the
head of any statesman of the age. It was recommended
by him;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> but neither his splendid abilities, nor his
unblemished integrity, could make head against the
prevailing prejudices, and he eventually retired into
private life without effecting any of his noble schemes.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, in the leading events of this period of French
history, the predominance of the theological spirit was
painfully shown. It was shown in the universal determination
to subordinate political acts to religious
opinions.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It was shown in the conspiracy of Amboise,
and in the conference of Poissy; and still more was it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
shown in those revolting crimes so natural to superstition,
the massacres of Vassy and of St. Bartholomew,
the murder of Guise by Poltrot, and of Henry III. by
Clement. These were the legitimate results of the spirit
of religious bigotry. They were the results of that
accursed spirit, which, whenever it has had the power,
has punished even to the death those who dared to
differ from it; and which, now that the power has
passed away, still continues to dogmatize on the most
mysterious subjects, tamper with the most sacred principles
of the human heart, and darken with its miserable
superstitions those sublime questions that no one
should rudely touch, because they are for each according
to the measure of his own soul, because they lie in
that unknown tract which separates the Finite from the
Infinite, and because they are as a secret and individual
covenant between Man and his God.</p>

<p>How long these sad days<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> would, in the ordinary
course of affairs, have been prolonged in France, is a
question which we now perhaps have no means of answering;
though there is no doubt that the progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
even of empirical knowledge must, according to the
process already pointed out, have eventually sufficed to
rescue so great a country from her degraded position.
Fortunately, however, there now took place what we
must be content to call an accident, but which was the
beginning of a most important change. In the year
1589, Henry IV. ascended the throne of France. This
great prince, who was far superior to any of the French
sovereigns of the sixteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> made small account
of those theological disputes which his predecessors
had thought to be of paramount importance.
Before him, the kings of France, animated by the piety
natural to the guardians of the church, had exerted all
their authority to uphold the interests of the sacred
profession. Francis I. said, that if his right hand were
a heretic, he would cut it off.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Henry II., whose zeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
was still greater,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> ordered the judges to proceed against
the Protestants, and publicly declared that he would
&lsquo;make the extirpation of the heretics his principal
business.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Charles IX., on the celebrated day of St.
Bartholomew, attempted to relieve the church by destroying
them at a single blow. Henry III. promised
to &lsquo;oppose heresy even at the risk of his life;&rsquo; for he
said, &lsquo;he could not find a prouder grave than amidst
the ruins of heresy.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>These were the opinions expressed, in the sixteenth
century, by the heads of the oldest monarchy in
Europe.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> But with such feelings, the powerful intellect
of Henry IV. had not the slightest sympathy. To
suit the shifting politics of his age, he had already
changed his religion twice; and he did not hesitate to
change it a third time,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> when he found that by doing so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
he could ensure tranquillity to his country. As he had
displayed such indifference about his own creed, he
could not with decency show much bigotry about the
creed of his subjects.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> We find, accordingly, that he
was the author of the first public act of toleration which
any government promulgated in France since Christianity
had been the religion of the country. Only five
years after he had solemnly abjured Protestantism, he
published the celebrated Edict of Nantes,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> by which,
for the first time, a Catholic government granted to
heretics a fair share of civil and religious rights. This
was, unquestionably, the most important event that had
yet occurred in the history of French civilization.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> If
it is considered by itself, it is merely an evidence of the
enlightened principles of the king; but when we look
at its general success, and at the cessation of religious
war which followed it, we cannot fail to perceive that
it was part of a vast movement, in which the people
themselves participated. Those who recognize the
truth of the principles I have laboured to establish, will
expect that this great step towards religious liberty
was accompanied by that spirit of scepticism, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
absence of which toleration has always been unknown.
And that this was actually the case, may be easily
proved by an examination of the transitionary state
which France began to enter towards the end of the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The writings of Rabelais are often considered to afford
the first instance of religious scepticism in the French
language.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> But, after a tolerably intimate acquaintance
with the works of this remarkable man, I have
found nothing to justify such an opinion. He certainly
treats the clergy with great disrespect, and takes every
opportunity of covering them with ridicule.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> His attacks,
however, are always made upon their personal
vices, and not upon that narrow and intolerant spirit to
which those vices were chiefly to be ascribed. In not
a single instance does he show any thing like consistent
scepticism;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> nor does he appear to be aware
that the disgraceful lives of the French clergy were but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the inevitable consequence of a system, which, corrupt
as it was, still possessed every appearance of strength
and vitality. Indeed, the immense popularity which he
enjoyed is, almost of itself, a decisive consideration;
since no one, who is well informed as to the condition
of the French early in the sixteenth century, will believe
it possible that a people, so sunk in superstition,
should delight in a writer by whom superstition is constantly
attacked.</p>

<p>But the extension of experience, and the consequent
increase of knowledge, were preparing the way for a
great change in the French intellect. The process,
which had just taken place in England, was now beginning
to take place in France; and in both countries the
order of events was precisely the same. The spirit
of doubt, hitherto confined to an occasional solitary
thinker, gradually assumed a bolder form: first it found
a vent in the national literature, and then it influenced
the conduct of practical statesmen. That there was,
in France, an intimate connexion between scepticism
and toleration, is proved, not only by those general
arguments which make us infer that such connexion
must always exist, but also by the circumstance, that
only a few years before the promulgation of the Edict
of Nantes, there appeared the first systematic sceptic
who wrote in the French language. The Essays of
Montaigne were published in 1588,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and form an epoch,
not only in the literature, but also in the civilization, of
France. Putting aside personal peculiarities, which have
less weight than is commonly supposed, it will be found
that the difference between Rabelais and Montaigne is
a measure of the difference between 1545<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and 1588,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and that it, in some degree, corresponds with the relation
I have indicated between Jewel and Hooker, and
between Hooker and Chillingworth. For, the law which
governs all these relations is the law of a progressive
scepticism. What Rabelais was to the supporters of
theology, that was Montaigne to the theology itself.
The writings of Rabelais were only directed against
the clergy; but the writings of Montaigne were
directed against the system of which the clergy were
the offspring.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Under the guise of a mere man of
the world, expressing natural thoughts in common
language, Montaigne concealed a spirit of lofty and
audacious inquiry.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Although he lacked that comprehensiveness
which is the highest form of genius,
he possessed other qualities essential to a great mind.
He was very cautious, and yet he was very bold. He
was cautious, since he would not believe strange things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
because they had been handed down by his forefathers;
and he was bold, since he was undaunted by the reproaches
with which the ignorant, who love to dogmatize,
always cover those whose knowledge makes them
ready to doubt.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> These peculiarities would, in any
age, have made Montaigne a useful man: in the sixteenth
century they made him an important one. At
the same time, his easy and amusing style<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> increased
the circulation of his works, and thus contributed to
popularize those opinions which he ventured to recommend
for general adoption.</p>

<p>This, then, is the first open declaration of that scepticism,
which, towards the end of the sixteenth century,
publicly appeared in France.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> During nearly three
generations, it continued its course with a constantly
increasing activity, and developed itself in a manner
similar to that which took place in England. It will
not be necessary to follow all the steps of this great
process; but I will endeavour to trace those which,
by their prominence, seem to be the most important.</p>

<p>A few years after the appearance of the Essays of
Montaigne, there was published in France a work, which
though now little read, possessed in the seventeenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
century a reputation of the highest order. This was
the celebrated <i>Treatise on Wisdom</i>, by Charron, in which
we find, for the first time, an attempt made in a modern
language to construct a system of morals without the
aid of theology.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> What rendered this book, in some
respects, even more formidable than Montaigne's, was
the air of gravity with which it was written. Charron
was evidently deeply impressed with the importance of
the task he had undertaken, and he is honourably distinguished
from his contemporaries, by a remarkable
purity both of language and of sentiment. His work
is almost the only one of that age in which nothing
can be found to offend the chastest ears. Although he
borrowed from Montaigne innumerable illustrations,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
he has carefully omitted those indecencies into which
that otherwise charming writer was often betrayed.
Besides this, there is about the work of Charron a
systematic completeness which never fails to attract
attention. In originality, he was, in some respects,
inferior to Montaigne; but he had the advantage of
coming after him, and there can be no doubt that he
rose to an elevation which, to Montaigne, would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
been inaccessible. Taking his stand, as it were, on the
summit of knowledge, he boldly attempts to enumerate
the elements of wisdom, and the conditions under which
those elements will work. In the scheme which he thus
constructs, he entirely omits theological dogmas;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and
he treats with undissembled scorn many of those conclusions
which the people had hitherto universally
received. He reminds his countrymen that their religion
is the accidental result of their birth and education,
and that if they had been born in a Mohammedan
country, they would have been as firm believers in Mohammedanism
as they then were in Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> From
this consideration, he insists on the absurdity of their
troubling themselves about the variety of creeds, seeing
that such variety is the result of circumstances over
which they have no control. Also it is to be observed,
that each of these different religions declares itself to
be the true one;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and all of them are equally based
upon supernatural pretensions, such as mysteries, miracles,
prophets, and the like.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> It is because men
forget these things, that they are the slaves of that
confidence which is the great obstacle to all real knowledge,
and which can only be removed by taking such
a large and comprehensive view, as will show us how
all nations cling with equal zeal to the tenets in which
they have been educated.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> And, says Charron, if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
look a little deeper, we shall see that each of the great
religions is built upon that which preceded it. Thus,
the religion of the Jews is founded upon that of the
Egyptians; Christianity is the result of Judaism; and,
from these two last, there has naturally sprung Mohammedanism.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
We, therefore, adds this great writer,
should rise above the pretensions of hostile sects, and,
without being terrified by the fear of future punishment,
or allured by the hope of future happiness,
we should be content with such practical religion as
consists in performing the duties of life; and, uncontrolled
by the dogmas of any particular creed, we should
strive to make the soul retire inward upon itself, and
by the efforts of its own contemplation, admire the
ineffable grandeur of the Being of beings, the supreme
cause of all created things.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Such were the sentiments which, in the year 1601,
were for the first time laid before the French people in
their own mother-tongue.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The sceptical and secular
spirit, of which they were the representatives, continued
to increase; and, as the seventeenth century
advanced, the decline of fanaticism, so far from being
confined to a few isolated thinkers, gradually became
common, even among ordinary politicians.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The clergy,
sensible of the danger, wished the government to check
the progress of inquiry;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and the pope himself, in a
formal remonstrance with Henry, urged him to remedy
the evil, by prosecuting the heretics, from whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
thought all the mischief had originally proceeded.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> But
this the king steadily refused. He saw the immense
advantages that would arise, if he could weaken the
ecclesiastical power by balancing the two sects against
each other;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and therefore, though he was a Catholic,
his policy rather leaned in favour of the Protestants,
as being the weaker party.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> He granted sums of
money towards the support of their ministers and the
repair of their churches;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> he banished the Jesuits,
who were their most dangerous enemies;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and he
always had with him two representatives of the reformed
church, whose business it was to inform him of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
any infraction of those edicts which he had issued in
favour of their religion.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Thus it was, that in France, as well as in England,
toleration was preceded by scepticism; and thus it
was, that out of this scepticism there arose the humane
and enlightened measures of Henry IV. The great
prince, by whom these things were effected, unhappily
fell a victim to that fanatical spirit which he had
done much to curb;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> but the circumstances which
occurred after his death, showed how great an impetus
had been given to the age.</p>

<p>On the murder of Henry IV., in 1610, the government
fell into the hands of the queen, who administered
it during the minority of her son, Louis XIII. And it
is a remarkable evidence of the direction which the
mind was now taking, that she, though a weak and
bigoted woman,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> refrained from those persecutions
which, only one generation before, had been considered
a necessary proof of religious sincerity. That, indeed,
must have been a movement of no common energy,
which could force toleration, early in the seventeenth
century, upon a princess of the house of Medici, an
ignorant and superstitious Catholic, who had been educated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in the midst of her priests, and had been accustomed
to look for their applause as the highest object
of earthly ambition.</p>

<p>Yet this was what actually occurred. The queen
continued the ministers of Henry IV., and announced,
that in every thing she would follow his example.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Her
first public act was, a declaration, that the Edict of
Nantes should be inviolably preserved; for, she says,
&lsquo;experience has taught our predecessors, that violence,
so far from inducing men to return to the Catholic
church, prevents them from doing so.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Indeed, so
anxious was she upon this point, that when Louis, in
1614, attained his nominal majority, the first act of his
government was another confirmation of the Edict of
Nantes.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> And, in 1615, she caused the king, who still
remained under her tutelage,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> to issue a declaration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
by which all preceding measures in favour of the Protestants
were publicly confirmed.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> In the same spirit,
she, in 1611, wished to raise to the presidency of parliament
the celebrated De Thou; and it was only by
making a formal announcement of his heresy, that the
pope succeeded in frustrating what he considered an
impious design.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The turn which things were now taking, caused no
little alarm to the friends of the hierarchy. The most
zealous churchmen loudly censured the policy of the
queen; and a great historian has observed that when,
during the reign of Louis XIII., such alarm was caused
in Europe by the active encroachments of the ecclesiastical
power, France was the first country that ventured
to oppose them.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The nuncio openly complained to
the queen of her conduct in favouring heretics; and he
anxiously desired that those Protestant works should
be suppressed, by which the consciences of true believers
were greatly scandalized.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> But these, and
similar representations, were no longer listened to with
the respect they would formerly have received; and the
affairs of the country continued to be administered with
those purely temporal views, on which the measures of
Henry IV. had been avowedly based.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Such was now the policy of the government of France;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
a government which, not many years before, had considered
it the great duty of a sovereign to punish heretics
and extirpate heresy. That this continued improvement
was merely the result of the general intellectual
development, is evident, not only from its success, but
also from the character of the queen-regent and the king.
No one who has read the contemporary memoirs, can deny
that Mary de Medici and Louis XIII. were as superstitious
as any of their predecessors; and it is, therefore,
evident, that this disregard of theological prejudices was
due, not to their own personal merits, but to the advancing
knowledge of the country, and to the pressure
of an age which, in the rapidity of its progress, hurried
along those who believed themselves to be its rulers.</p>

<p>But these considerations, weighty as they are, will
only slightly diminish the merit of that remarkable
man, who now appeared on the stage of public affairs.
During the last eighteen years of the reign of
Louis XIII., France was entirely governed by Richelieu,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
one of that extremely small class of statesmen
to whom it is given to impress their own character on
the destiny of their country. This great ruler has, in
his knowledge of the political art, probably never been
surpassed, except by that prodigy of genius who, in our
time, troubled the fortunes of Europe. But, in one
important view, Richelieu was superior to Napoleon.
The life of Napoleon was a constant effort to oppress
the liberties of mankind; and his unrivalled capacity
exhausted its resources in struggling against the tendencies
of a great age. Richelieu, too, was a despot;
but his despotism took a nobler turn. He displayed,
what Napoleon never possessed, a just appreciation of
the spirit of his own time. In one great point, indeed,
he failed. His attempts to destroy the power of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
French nobility were altogether futile;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> for, owing to
a long course of events, the authority of that insolent
class was so deeply rooted in the popular mind, that the
labours of another century were required to efface its
ancient influence. But, though Richelieu could not
diminish the social and moral weight of the French
nobles, he curtailed their political privileges; and he
chastised their crimes with a severity which, for a time
at least, repressed their former license.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> So little,
however, can even the ablest statesman effect, unless he
is seconded by the general temper of the age in which
he lives, that these checks, rude as they were, produced
no permanent result. After his death, the French
nobles, as we shall presently see, quickly rallied; and,
in the wars of the Fronde, debased that great struggle
into a mere contest of rival families. Nor was it until
the close of the eighteenth century, that France was
finally relieved from the overweening influence of that
powerful class, whose selfishness had long retarded the
progress of civilization, by retaining the people in a
thraldom, from the remote effects of which they have
not yet fully recovered.</p>

<p>Although in this respect Richelieu failed in achieving
his designs, he in other matters met with signal success.
This was owing to the fact, that his large and comprehensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
views harmonized with that sceptical tendency,
of which I have just given some account. For this
remarkable man, though he was a bishop and a cardinal,
never for a moment allowed the claims of his profession
to make him forego the superior claims of his country.
He knew, what is too often forgotten, that the governor
of a people should measure affairs solely by a political
standard, and should pay no regard to the pretensions
of any sect, or the propagation of any opinions, except
in reference to the present and practical welfare of men.
The consequence was, that, during his administration,
there was seen the marvellous spectacle of supreme
authority wielded by a priest, who took no pains to increase
the power of the spiritual classes. Indeed, so
far from this, he often treated them with what was then
considered unexampled rigour. The royal confessors,
on account of the importance of their functions, had
always been regarded with a certain veneration; they
were supposed to be men of unspotted piety; they had
hitherto possessed immense influence, and even the
most powerful statesmen had thought it advisable to
show them the deference due to their exalted position.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
Richelieu, however, was too familiar with the arts of
his profession, to feel much respect for these keepers of
the consciences of kings. Caussin, the confessor of
Louis XIII., had, it seems, followed the example of his
predecessors, and endeavoured to instill his own views
of policy into the mind of the royal penitent.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Richelieu, so soon as he heard of this, dismissed him
from office, and sent him into exile; for, he contemptuously
says, &lsquo;the little father Caussin&rsquo; should not interfere
in matters of government, since he is one of
those &lsquo;who have always been brought up in the innocence
of a religious life.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Caussin was succeeded by
the celebrated Sirmond; but Richelieu would not allow
the new confessor to begin his duties, until he had
solemnly promised never to interfere in state affairs.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>On another occasion of much more importance,
Richelieu displayed a similar spirit. The French clergy
were then possessed of enormous wealth; and, as they
enjoyed the privilege of taxing themselves, they were
careful not to make what they considered unnecessary
contributions towards defraying the expenses of the
state. They had cheerfully advanced money to carry
on war against the Protestants, because they believed it
to be their duty to assist in the extirpation of heresy.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
But they saw no reason why their revenues should be
wasted in effecting mere temporal benefits; they considered
themselves as the guardians of funds set apart
for spiritual purposes, and they thought it impious that
wealth consecrated by the piety of their ancestors
should fall into the profane hands of secular statesmen.
Richelieu, who looked on these scruples as the artifices
of interested men, had taken a very different view
of the relation which the clergy bore to the country.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
So far from thinking that the interests of the church
were superior to those of the state, he laid it down as
a maxim of policy, that &lsquo;the reputation of the state
was the first consideration.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> With such fearlessness
did he carry out this principle, that having convoked
at Nantes a great assembly of the clergy, he compelled
them to aid the government by an extraordinary supply
of 6,000,000 francs; and finding that some of the
highest dignitaries had expressed their discontent at so
unusual a step, he laid hands on them also, and to the
amazement of the church, sent into exile not only four
of the bishops, but likewise the two archbishops of
Toulouse and of Sens.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>If these things had been done fifty years earlier, they
would most assuredly have proved fatal to the minister
who dared to attempt them. But Richelieu, in these
and similar measures, was aided by the spirit of an age
which was beginning to despise its ancient masters.
For this general tendency was now becoming apparent,
not only in literature and in politics, but even in the
proceedings of the ordinary tribunals. The nuncio indignantly
complained of the hostility displayed against
ecclesiastics by the French judges; and he said that,
among other shameful things, some clergymen had been
hung, without being first deprived of their spiritual
character.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> On other occasions, the increasing contempt
showed itself in a way well suited to the coarseness
of the prevailing manners. Sourdis, the archbishop
of Bourdeaux, was twice ignominiously beaten; once
by the Duke d'Epernon, and afterwards by the Maréchal
de Vitry.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Nor did Richelieu, who usually treated
the nobles with such severity, seem anxious to punish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
this gross outrage. Indeed, the archbishop not only
received no sympathy, but, a few years later, was peremptorily
ordered by Richelieu to retire to his own
diocese; such, however, was his alarm at the state of
affairs, that he fled to Carpentras, and put himself under
the protection of the pope.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> This happened in 1641
and nine years earlier, the church had incurred a still
greater scandal. For in 1632, serious disturbances
having arisen in Languedoc, Richelieu did not fear to
meet the difficulty by depriving some of the bishops, and
seizing the temporalities of the others.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The indignation of the clergy may be easily imagined.
Such repeated injuries, even if they had proceeded from
a layman, would have been hard to endure; but they
were rendered doubly bitter by being the work of one
of themselves&mdash;one who had been nurtured in the profession
against which he turned. This it was which
aggravated the offence, because it seemed to be adding
treachery to insult. It was not a war from without,
but it was a treason from within. It was a bishop
who humbled the episcopacy, and a cardinal who
affronted the church.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Such, however, was the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
temper of men, that the clergy did not venture to strike
an open blow; but, by means of their partisans, they
scattered the most odious libels against the great minister.
They said that he was unchaste, that he was
guilty of open debauchery, and that he held incestuous
commerce with his own niece.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> They declared that he
had no religion; that he was only a Catholic in name;
that he was the pontiff of the Huguenots; that he was
the patriarch of atheists;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and what was worse than
all, they even accused him of wishing to establish a
schism in the French church.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Happily the time was
now passing away in which the national mind could be
moved by such artifices as these. Still the charges are
worth recording, because they illustrate the tendency
of public affairs, and the bitterness with which the
spiritual classes saw the reins of power falling from
their hands. Indeed, all this was so manifest, that in
the last civil war raised against Richelieu, only two
years before his death, the insurgents stated in their
proclamation, that one of their objects was to revive the
respect with which the clergy and nobles had formerly
been treated.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>The more we study the career of Richelieu, the more
prominent does this antagonism become. Every thing
proves that he was conscious of a great struggle going
on between the old ecclesiastical scheme of government
and the new secular scheme; and that he was determined
to put down the old plan, and uphold the new one.
For, not only in his domestic administration, but also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in his foreign policy, do we find the same unprecedented
disregard of theological interests. The House of Austria,
particularly its Spanish branch, had long been respected
by all pious men as the faithful ally of the church; it
was looked upon as the scourge of heresy; and its proceedings
against the heretics had won for it a great
name in ecclesiastical history.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> When, therefore, the
French government, in the reign of Charles IX., made
a deliberate attempt to destroy the Protestants, France
naturally established an intimate connexion with Spain
as well as with Rome;<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and these three great powers
were firmly united, not by a community of temporal interests,
but by the force of a religious compact. This
theological confederacy was afterwards broken up by
the personal character of Henry IV.,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and by the growing
indifference of the age; but during the minority of
Louis XIII., the queen-regent had in some degree renewed
it, and had attempted to revive the superstitious
prejudices upon which it was based.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> In all her feelings,
she was a zealous Catholic; she was warmly
attached to Spain; and she succeeded in marrying her
son, the young king, to a Spanish princess, and her
daughter to a Spanish prince.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>It might have been expected that when Richelieu, a
great dignitary of the Romish church, was placed at
the head of affairs, he would have reëstablished a connexion
so eagerly desired by the profession to which he
belonged.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> But his conduct was not regulated by
such views as these. His object was, not to favour the
opinions of a sect, but to promote the interests of a
nation. His treaties, his diplomacy, and the schemes
of his foreign alliances, were all directed, not against
the enemies of the church, but against the enemies of
France. By erecting this new standard of action,
Richelieu took a great step towards secularizing the
whole system of European politics. For he thus made
the theoretical interests of men subordinate to their
practical interests. Before his time, the rulers of
France, in order to punish their Protestant subjects,
had not hesitated to demand the aid of the Catholic
troops of Spain; and in so doing, they merely acted
upon the old opinion, that it was the chief duty of a
government to suppress heresy. This pernicious doctrine
was first openly repudiated by Richelieu. As early
as 1617, and before he had established his power, he,
in an instruction to one of the foreign ministers which is
still extant, laid it down as a principle, that, in matters
of state, no Catholic ought to prefer a Spaniard to a
French Protestant.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> To us, indeed, in the progress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
society, such preference of the claims of our country to
those of our creed, has become a matter of course; but
in those days it was a startling novelty.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Richelieu,
however, did not fear to push the paradox even to its
remotest consequences. The Catholic church justly considered
that its interests were bound up with those of
the House of Austria;<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> but Richelieu, directly he was
called to the council, determined to humble that house
in both its branches.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> To effect this, he openly supported
the bitterest enemies of his own religion. He
aided the Lutherans against the Emperor of Germany; he
aided the Calvinists against the king of Spain. During
the eighteen years he was supreme, he steadily pursued
the same undeviating policy.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> When Philip attempted
to repress the Dutch Protestants, Richelieu made common
cause with them; at first, advancing them large
sums of money, and afterwards inducing the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
king to sign a treaty of intimate alliance with those
who, in the opinion of the church, he ought rather to
have chastized as rebellious heretics.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> In the same
way, when that great war broke out, in which the emperor
attempted to subjugate to the true faith the consciences
of German Protestants, Richelieu stood forward
as their protector; he endeavoured from the beginning
to save their leader the Palatine;<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and, failing in that,
he concluded in their favour an alliance with Gustavus
Adolphus,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> the ablest military commander the Reformers
had then produced. Nor did he stop there.
After the death of Gustavus, he, seeing that the Protestants
were thus deprived of their great leader, made
still more vigorous efforts in their favour.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> He intrigued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
for them in foreign courts; he opened negotiations
in their behalf; and eventually he organized for
their protection a public confederacy, in which all
ecclesiastical considerations were set at defiance. This
league, which formed an important precedent in the
international polity of Europe, was not only contracted
by Richelieu with the two most powerful enemies of his
own church, but it was, from its tenor, what Sismondi
emphatically calls a &lsquo;Protestant confederation&rsquo;&mdash;a Protestant
confederation, he says, between France, England,
and Holland.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>These things alone would have made the administration
of Richelieu a great epoch in the history of
European civilization. For his government affords the
first example of an eminent Catholic statesman systematically
disregarding ecclesiastical interests, and showing
that disregard in the whole scheme of his foreign,
as well as of his domestic, policy. Some instances,
indeed, approaching to this, may be found, at an earlier
period, among the petty rulers of Italian states; but,
even there, such attempts have never been successful;
they had never been continued for any length of time,
nor had they been carried out on a scale large enough
to raise them to the dignity of international precedents.
The peculiar glory of Richelieu is, that his
foreign policy was, not occasionally, but invariably,
governed by temporal considerations; nor do I believe
that, during the long tenure of his power, there is to
be found the least proof of his regard for those theological
interests, the promotion of which had long been
looked upon as a matter of paramount importance.
By thus steadily subordinating the church to the state;
by enforcing the principle of this subordination, on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
large scale, with great ability, and with unvarying success,
he laid the foundation of that purely secular
polity, the consolidation of which has, since his death,
been the aim of all the best European diplomatists.
The result was a most salutary change, which had
been for some time preparing, but which, under him,
was first completed. For, by the introduction of this
system, an end was put to religious wars; and the
chances of peace were increased, by thus removing one
of the causes to which the interruption of peace had
often been owing.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> At the same time, there was prepared
the way for that final separation of theology from
politics, which it will be the business of future generations
fully to achieve. How great a step had been
taken in this direction, appears from the facility with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
which the operations of Richelieu were continued by
men every way his inferiors. Less than two years after
his death, there was assembled the Congress of Westphalia;<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
the members of which concluded that celebrated
peace, which is remarkable, as being the first
comprehensive attempt to adjust the conflicting interests
of the leading European countries.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> In this
important treaty, ecclesiastical interests were altogether
disregarded;<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and the contracting parties, instead of,
as heretofore, depriving each other of their possessions,
took the bolder course of indemnifying themselves at
the expense of the church, and did not hesitate to seize
her revenues, and secularize several of her bishoprics.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
From this grievous insult, which became a precedent
in the public law of Europe, the spiritual power has
never recovered; and it is remarked by a very competent
authority that, since that period, diplomatists
have, in their official acts, neglected religious interests,
and have preferred the advocacy of matters relating
to the commerce and colonies of their respective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
countries.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The truth of this observation is confirmed
by the interesting fact, that the Thirty Years' War, to
which this same treaty put an end, is the last great religious
war which has ever been waged;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> no civilized
people, during two centuries, having thought it worth
while to peril their own safety in order to disturb the
belief of their neighbours. This, indeed, is but a part
of that vast secular movement, by which superstition
has been weakened, and the civilization of Europe secured.
Without, however, discussing that subject, I
will now endeavour to show how the policy of Richelieu,
in regard to the French Protestant church, corresponded
with his policy in regard to the French Catholic church;
so, that, in both departments, this great statesman,
aided by that progress of knowledge for which his age
was remarkable, was able to struggle with prejudices
from which men, slowly and with infinite difficulty,
were attempting to emerge.</p>

<p>The treatment of the French Protestants by Richelieu
is, undoubtedly, one of the most honourable parts of
his system; and in it, as in other liberal measures, he
was assisted by the course of preceding events. His administration,
taken in connexion with that of Henry IV.
and the queen-regent, presents the noble spectacle of
a toleration far more complete than any which had
then been seen in Catholic Europe. While in other Christian
countries, men were being incessantly persecuted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
simply because they held opinions different from those
professed by the established clergy, France refused to
follow the general example, and protected those heretics
whom the church was eager to punish. Indeed, not
only were they protected, but, when they possessed
abilities, they were openly rewarded. In addition to
their appointments to civil offices, many of them were
advanced to high military posts; and Europe beheld,
with astonishment, the armies of the king of France
led by heretical generals. Rohan, Lesdiguières, Chatillon,
La Force, Bernard de Weimar, were among the
most celebrated of the military leaders employed by
Louis XIII.; and all of them were Protestants, as also
were some younger, but distinguished officers, such as
Gassion, Rantzau, Schomberg, and Turenne. For now,
nothing was beyond the reach of men who, half a century
earlier, would, on account of their heresies, have
been persecuted to the death. Shortly before the accession
of Louis XIII., Lesdiguières, the ablest general
among the French Protestants, was made marshal of
France.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Fourteen years later, the same high dignity
was conferred upon two other Protestants, Chatillon
and La Force; the former of whom is said to have
been the most influential of the schismatics.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Both
these appointments were in 1622;<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and, in 1634, still
greater scandal was caused by the elevation of Sully,
who, notwithstanding his notorious heresy, also received
the staff of marshal of France.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> This was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
work of Richelieu, and it gave serious offence to the
friends of the church; but the great statesman paid so
little attention to their clamour, that, after the civil
war was concluded, he took another step equally obnoxious.
The Duke de Rohan was the most active of
all the enemies of the established church, and was
looked up to by the Protestants as the main support
of their party. He had taken up arms in their favour,
and, declining to abandon his religion, had, by the fate
of war, been driven from France. But Richelieu, who
was acquainted with his ability, cared little about his
opinions. He, therefore, recalled him from exile, employed
him in a negotiation with Switzerland, and sent
him on foreign service, as commander of one of the
armies of the king of France.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Such were the tendencies which characterized this
new state of things. It is hardly necessary to observe
how beneficial this great change must have been; since
by it men were encouraged to look to their country as
the first consideration, and, discarding their old disputes,
Catholic soldiers were taught to obey heretical
generals, and follow their standards to victory. In addition
to this, the mere social amalgamation, arising
from the professors of different creeds mixing in the
same camp, and fighting under the same banner, must
have still further aided to disarm the mind, partly by
merging theological feuds in a common, and yet a temporal,
object, and partly by showing to each sect, that
their religious opponents were not entirely bereft of
human virtue; that they still retained some of the
qualities of men; and that it was even possible to combine
the errors of heresy with all the capabilities of a
good and competent citizen.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>But, while the hateful animosities by which France
had long been distracted, were, under the policy of Richelieu,
gradually subsiding, it is singular to observe that,
though the prejudices of the Catholics obviously diminished,
those of the Protestants seemed, for a time, to
retain all their activity. It is, indeed, a striking proof
of the perversity and pertinacity of such feelings, that it
was precisely in the country, and at the period, when
the Protestants were best treated, that they displayed
most turbulence. And in this, as in all such cases, the
cause principally at work was the influence of that class
to which circumstances, I will now explain, had secured
a temporary ascendency.</p>

<p>For, the diminution of the theological spirit had effected
in the Protestants a remarkable but a very natural
result. The increasing toleration of the French government
had laid open to their leaders prizes which before
they could never have obtained. As long as all offices
were refused to the Protestant nobles, it was natural
that they should cling with the greater zeal to their own
party, by whom alone their virtues were acknowledged.
But, when the principle was once recognised, that the
state would reward men for their abilities, without regard
to their religion, there was introduced into every
sect a new element of discord. The leaders of the Reformers
could not fail to feel some gratitude, or, at all
events, some interest for the government which employed
them; and the influence of temporal considerations
being thus strengthened, the influence of religious
ties must have been weakened. It is impossible
that opposite feelings should be paramount, at the
same moment, in the same mind. The further men
extend their view, the less they care for each of the
details of which the view is composed. Patriotism is
a corrective of superstition; and the more we feel for
our country, the less we feel for our sect. Thus it is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that in the progress of civilization, the scope of the
intellect is widened; its horizon is enlarged; its
sympathies are multiplied; and, as the range of its
excursions is increased, the tenacity of its grasp is
slackened, until, at length, it begins to perceive that
the infinite variety of circumstances necessarily causes
an infinite variety of opinions; that a creed, which is
good and natural for one man, may be bad and unnatural
for another; and that, so far from interfering
with the march of religious convictions, we should be
content to look into ourselves, search our own hearts,
purge our own souls, soften the evil of our own passions,
and extirpate that insolent and intolerant spirit, which
is at once the cause and the effect of all theological
controversy.</p>

<p>It was in this direction, that a prodigious step was
taken by the French in the first half of the seventeenth
century. Unfortunately, however, the advantages which
arose were accompanied by serious drawbacks. From
the introduction of temporal considerations among the
Protestant leaders, there occurred two results of considerable
importance. The first result was, that many
of the Protestants changed their religion. Before the
Edict of Nantes, they had been constantly persecuted,
and had, as constantly, increased.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> But, under the
tolerant policy of Henry IV. and Louis XIII., they continued
to diminish.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Indeed, this was the natural
consequence of the growth of that secular spirit which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in every country, has assuaged religious animosities.
For, by the action of that spirit, the influence of social
and political views began to outweigh those theological
views to which the minds of men had long been confined.
As these temporal ties increased in strength,
there was, of course, generated among the rival factions
an increased tendency to assimilate; while, as the Catholics
were not only much more numerous, but in every
respect, more influential, than their opponents, they
reaped the benefit of this movement, and gradually drew
over to their side many of their former enemies. That
this absorption of the smaller sect into the larger, is
due to the cause I have mentioned, is rendered still
more evident by the interesting fact, that the change
began among the heads of the party; and that it was
not the inferior Protestants who first abandoned their
leaders, but it was rather the leaders who deserted their
followers. This was because the leaders, being more
educated than the great body of the people, were more
susceptible to the sceptical movement, and therefore set
the example of an indifference to disputes which still
engrossed the popular mind. As soon as this indifference
had reached a certain point, the attractions offered
by the conciliating policy of Louis XIII. became irresistible;
and the Protestant nobles, in particular, being
most exposed to political temptations, began to alienate
themselves from their own party, in order to form an
alliance with a court which showed itself ready to reward
their merits.</p>

<p>It is, of course, impossible to fix the exact period at
which this important change took place.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> But we
may say with certainty, that very early in the reign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Louis XIII. many of the Protestant nobles cared nothing
for their religion, while the remainder of them ceased
to feel that interest in it which they had formerly expressed.
Indeed, some of the most eminent of them
openly abandoned their creed, and joined that very
church which they had been taught to abhor as the man
of sin, and the whore of Babylon. The Duke de Lesdiguières,
the greatest of all the Protestant generals,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
became a Catholic, and, as a reward for his conversion,
was made constable of France.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The Duke de la
Tremouille adopted the same course;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> as also did the
Duke de la Meilleraye,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> the Duke de Bouillon,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and
a few years later the Marquis de Montausier.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> These
illustrious nobles were among the most powerful of the
members of the Reformed communion; but they quitted
it without compunction, sacrificing their old associations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in favour of the opinions professed by the state. Among
the other men of high rank, who still remained nominally
connected with the French Protestants, we find a
similar spirit. We find them lukewarm respecting
matters, for which, if they had been born fifty years
earlier, they would have laid down their lives. The
Maréchal de Bouillon, who professed himself to be a
Protestant, was unwilling to change his religion; but
he so comported himself as to show that he considered
its interests as subordinate to political considerations.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
A similar remark has been made by the French
historians concerning the Duke de Sully and the
Marquis de Chatillon, both of whom, though they were
members of the Reformed church, displayed a marked
indifference to those theological interests which had
formerly been objects of supreme importance.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The
result was, that when, in 1621, the Protestants began
their civil war against the government, it was found
that of all their great leaders, two only, Rohan and his
brother Soubise, were prepared to risk their lives in
support of their religion.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus it was, that the first great consequence of the
tolerating policy of the French government was to deprive
the Protestants of the support of their former leaders,
and, in several instances, even to turn their sympathies
on the side of the Catholic church. But the other
consequence, to which I have alluded, was one of far
greater moment. The growing indifference of the
higher classes of Protestants threw the management
of their party into the hands of the clergy. The post,
which was deserted by the secular leaders, was naturally
seized by the spiritual leaders. And as, in every sect,
the clergy, as a body, have always been remarkable for
their intolerance of opinions different to their own, it
followed, that this change infused into the now mutilated
ranks of the Protestants an acrimony not inferior to
that of the worst times of the sixteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
Hence it was, that by a singular, but perfectly natural
combination, the Protestants, who professed to take
their stand on the right of private judgment, became,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
early in the seventeenth century, more intolerant than
the Catholics, who based their religion on the dictates
of an infallible church.</p>

<p>This is one of the many instances which show how
superficial is the opinion of those speculative writers,
who believe that the Protestant religion is necessarily
more liberal than the Catholic. If those who adopt
this view had taken the pains to study the history of
Europe in its original sources, they would have learned,
that the liberality of every sect depends, not at all on
its avowed tenets, but on the circumstances in which it
is placed, and on the amount of authority possessed by
its priesthood. The Protestant religion is, for the most
part, more tolerant than the Catholic, simply because
the events which have given rise to Protestantism have
at the same time increased the play of the intellect, and
therefore lessened the power of the clergy. But whoever
has read the works of the great Calvinist divines,
and above all, whoever has studied their history, must
know, that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
the desire of persecuting their opponents burnt as hotly
among them, as it did among any of the Catholics even
in the worst days of the papal dominion. This is a mere
matter of fact, of which any one may satisfy himself, by
consulting the original documents of those times. And
even now, there is more superstition, more bigotry, and
less of the charity of real religion, among the lower
order of Scotch Protestants, than there is among the
lower order of French Catholics. Yet for one intolerant
passage in Protestant theology, it would be easy to
point out twenty in Catholic theology. The truth, however,
is, that the actions of men are governed, not by
dogmas, and text-books, and rubrics, but by the
opinions and habits of their contemporaries, by the
general spirit of their age, and by the character of those
classes who are in the ascendant. This seems to be the
origin of that difference between religious theory and
religious practice, of which theologians greatly complain
as a stumbling-block and an evil. For, religious theories
being preserved in books, in a doctrinal and dogmatic
form, remain a perpetual witness, and, therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
cannot be changed without incurring the obvious charge
of inconsistency, or of heresy. But the practical part
of every religion, its moral, political, and social workings,
embrace such an immense variety of interests, and
have to do with such complicated and shifting agencies,
that it is hopeless to fix them by formularies: they,
even in the most rigid systems, are left, in a great measure,
to private discretion; and, being almost entirely
unwritten, they lack those precautions by which the
permanence of dogmas is effectually secured.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Hence
it is, that while the religious doctrines professed by a
people in their national creed are no criterion of their
civilization, their religious practice is, on the other
hand, so pliant and so capable of adaptation to social
wants, that it forms one of the best standards by which
the spirit of any age can be measured.</p>

<p>It is on account of these things, that we ought not
to be surprised that, during many years, the French
Protestants, who affected to appeal to the right of
private judgment, were more intolerant of the exercise
of that judgment by their adversaries than were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Catholics; although the Catholics, by recognising an
infallible church, ought, in consistency, to be superstitious,
and may be said to inherit intolerance as their
natural birthright.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Thus, while the Catholics were
theoretically more bigoted than the Protestants, the
Protestants became practically more bigoted than the
Catholics. The Protestants continued to insist upon
that right of private judgment in religion, which
the Catholics continued to deny. Yet, such was the
force of circumstances, that each sect, in its practice,
contradicted its own dogma, and acted as if it had embraced
the dogma of its opponents. The cause of this
change was very simple. Among the French, the theological
spirit, as we have already seen, was decaying;
and the decline of the influence of the clergy was, as
invariably happens, accompanied by an increase of
toleration. But, among the French Protestants, this
partial diminution of the theological spirit had produced
different consequences; because it had brought
about a change of leaders, which threw the command into
the hands of the clergy, and, by increasing their power,
provoked a reaction, and revived those very feelings to
the decay of which the reaction owed its origin. This
seems to explain how it is, that a religion, which is
not protected by the government, usually displays
greater energy and greater vitality than one which is
so protected. In the progress of society, the theological
spirit first declines among the most educated
classes; and then it is that the government can step
in, as it does in England, and, controlling the clergy,
make the church a creature of the state; thus weakening
the ecclesiastical element by tempering it with
secular considerations. But, when the state refuses to
do this, the reins of power, as they fall from the hands
of the upper classes, are seized by the clergy, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
arises a state of things of which the French Protestants
in the seventeenth century, and the Irish Catholics in
our own time, form the best illustration. In such cases,
it will always happen, that the religion which is tolerated
by the government, though not fully recognised
by it, will the longest retain its vitality; because its
priesthood, neglected by the state, must cling closer to
the people, in whom alone is the source of their power.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
On the other hand, in a religion which is favoured and
richly endowed by the state, the union between the
priesthood and inferior laity will be less intimate; the
clergy will look to the government as well as to the
people; and the interference of political views, of considerations
of temporal expediency, and, if it may be
added without irreverence, the hopes of promotion
will secularize the ecclesiastical spirit,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> and, according
to the process I have already traced, will thus hasten
the march of toleration.</p>

<p>These generalizations, which account for a great
part of the present superstition of the Irish Catholics,
will also account for the former superstition of the
French Protestants. In both cases, the government
disdaining the supervision of an heretical religion,
allowed supreme authority to fall into the hands of the
priesthood, who stimulated the bigotry of men, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
encouraged them in a hatred of their opponents. What
the results of this are in Ireland, is best known to those
of our statesmen, who, with unusual candour, have declared
Ireland to be their greatest difficulty. What
the results were in France, we will now endeavour to
ascertain.</p>

<p>The conciliating spirit of the French government
having drawn over to its side some of the most eminent
of the French Protestants, and having disarmed
the hostility of others, the leadership of the party fell,
as we have already seen, into the hands of those inferior
men, who displayed in their new position the intolerance
characteristic of their order. Without pretending
to write a history of the odious feuds that now arose,
I will lay before the reader some evidence of their increasing
bitterness; and I will point out a few of the
steps by which the angry feelings of religious controversy
became so inflamed, that at length they kindled
a civil war, which nothing but the improved temper
of the Catholics prevented from being as sanguinary
as were the horrible struggles of the sixteenth century.
For, when the French Protestants became governed
by men whose professional habits made them consider
heresy to be the greatest of crimes, there naturally
sprung up a missionary and proselytizing spirit, which
induced them to interfere with the religion of the Catholics,
and, under the old pretence of turning them
from the error of their ways, revived those animosities
which the progress of knowledge tended to appease.
And as, under such guidance, these feelings quickly
increased, the Protestants soon learned to despise that
great Edict of Nantes, by which their liberties were
secured; and they embarked in a dangerous contest,
in which their object was, not to protect their own
religion, but to weaken the religion of that very party
to whom they owed a toleration, which had been reluctantly
conceded by the prejudices of the age.</p>

<p>It was stipulated, in the Edict of Nantes, that the
Protestants should enjoy the full exercise of their religion;
and this right they continued to possess until the
reign of Louis XIV. To this there were added several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
other privileges, such as no Catholic Government, except
that of France, would then have granted to its
heretical subjects. But these things did not satisfy the
desires of the Protestant clergy. They were not content
to exercise their own religion, unless they could
also trouble the religion of others. Their first step was,
to call upon the government to limit the performance
of those rites which the French Catholics had long
revered as emblems of the national faith. For this purpose,
directly after the death of Henry IV. they held
a great assembly at Saumur, in which they formally
demanded that no Catholic processions should be
allowed in any town, place, or castle occupied by the
Protestants.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> As the government did not seem inclined
to countenance this monstrous pretension, these
intolerant sectaries took the law into their own hands.
They not only attacked the Catholic processions
wherever they met them, but they subjected the priests
to personal insults, and even endeavoured to prevent
them from administering the sacrament to the sick. If
a Catholic clergyman was engaged in burying the dead,
the Protestants were sure to be present, interrupting
the funeral, turning the ceremonies into ridicule, and
attempting, by their clamour, to deaden the voice of the
minister, so that the service performed in the church
should not be heard.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Nor did they always confine
themselves even to such demonstrations as these. For,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
certain towns having been, perhaps imprudently, placed
under their control, they exercised their authority in
them with the most wanton insolence. At La Rochelle,
which for importance was the second city in the kingdom,
they would not permit the Catholics to have even
a single church in which to celebrate what for centuries
had been the sole religion of France, and was still the
religion of an enormous majority of Frenchmen.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
This, however, only formed part of a system, by which
the Protestant clergy hoped to trample on the rights of
their fellow-subjects. In 1619, they ordered in their
general assembly at Loudun, that in none of the Protestant
towns should there be a sermon preached by a
Jesuit, or indeed by any ecclesiastical person commissioned
by a bishop.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> In another assembly, they forbade
any Protestant even to be present at a baptism,
or at a marriage, or at a funeral, if the ceremony was
performed by a Catholic priest.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> And, as if to cut off
all hope of reconciliation, they not only vehemently
opposed those intermarriages between the two parties,
by which, in every Christian country, religious animosities
have been softened, but they publicly declared, that
they would withhold the sacrament from any parents
whose children were married into a Catholic family.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
Not, however, to accumulate unnecessary evidence,
there is one other circumstance worth relating, as a
proof of the spirit with which these and similar regulations
were enforced. When Louis XIII., in 1620,
visited Pau, he was not only treated with indignity, as
being an heretical prince, but he found that the Protestants
had not left him a single church, not one place,
in which the king of France, in his own territory, could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
perform those devotions which he believed necessary
for his future salvation.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>This was the way in which the French Protestants,
influenced by their new leaders, treated the first Catholic
government which abstained from persecuting them;
the first which not only allowed them the free exercise
of their religion, but even advanced many of them to
offices of trust and of honour.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> All this, however, was
only of a piece with the rest of their conduct. They,
who in numbers and in intellect formed a miserable
minority of the French nation, claimed a power which
the majority had abandoned, and refused to concede to
others the toleration they themselves enjoyed. Several
persons, who had joined their party, now quitted it,
and returned to the Catholic church; but for exercising
this undoubted right, they were insulted by the Protestant
clergy in the grossest manner, with every term
of opprobrium and abuse.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> For those who resisted their
authority, no treatment was considered too severe. In
1612, Ferrier, a man of some reputation in his own day,
having disobeyed their injunctions, was ordered to appear
before one of their synods. The gist of his offence
was, that he had spoken contemptuously of ecclesiastical
assemblies; and to this there were, of course, added
those accusations against his moral conduct, with which
theologians often attempt to blacken the character of
their opponents.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Readers of ecclesiastical history
are too familiar with such charges to attach any importance
to them; but as, in this case, the accused was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
tried by men who were at once his prosecutors, his
enemies, and his judges, the result was easy to anticipate.
In 1613 Ferrier was excommunicated, and the excommunication
was publicly proclaimed in the church of
Nîmes. In this sentence, which is still extant, he is
declared by the clergy to be &lsquo;a scandalous man, a person
incorrigible, impenitent and ungovernable.&rsquo; We,
therefore, they add, &lsquo;in the name and power of our Lord
Jesus Christ, by the conduct of the Holy Ghost, and
with authority from the church, have cast, and do now
cast and throw him out of the society of the faithful,
that he may be delivered up unto Satan.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>That he may be delivered up unto Satan! This was
the penalty which a handful of clergymen, in a corner
of France, thought they could inflict on a man who
dared to despise their authority. In our time such an
anathema would only excite derision;<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> but, early in
the seventeenth century, the open promulgation of it
was enough to ruin any private person against whom it
might be directed. And they whose studies have enabled
them to take the measure of the ecclesiastical
spirit will easily believe that, in that age, the threat did
not remain a dead letter. The people, inflamed by their
clergy, rose against Ferrier, attacked his family, destroyed
his property, sacked and gutted his houses, and
demanded with loud cries, that the &lsquo;traitor Judas&rsquo;
should be given up to them. The unhappy man, with
the greatest difficulty, effected his escape; but though
he saved his life by flying in the dead of the night, he
was obliged to abandon for ever his native town, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
dared not return to a place where he had provoked so
active and so implacable a party.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Into other matters, and even into those connected
with the ordinary functions of government, the Protestants
carried the same spirit. Although they formed
so small a section of the people, they attempted to control
the administration of the crown, and, by the use
of threats, turn all its acts to their own favour. They
would not allow the state to determine what ecclesiastical
councils it should recognize; they would not even
permit the king to choose his own wife. In 1615,
without the least pretence of complaint, they assembled
in large numbers at Grenoble and at Nîmes.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The
deputies of Grenoble insisted that government should
refuse to acknowledge the Council of Trent;<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and
both assemblies ordered that the Protestants should
prevent the marriage of Louis XIII. with a Spanish
princess.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> They laid similar claims to interfere with
the disposal of civil and military offices. Shortly after
the death of Henry IV., they, in an assembly at Saumur,
insisted that Sully should be restored to some
posts from which, in their opinion, he had been unjustly
removed.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> In 1619, another of their assemblies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
at London declared, that as one of the Protestant
councillors of the Parliament of Paris had become a
Catholic, he must be dismissed; and they demanded
that, for the same reason, the government of Lectoure
should be taken from Fontrailles, he also having
adopted the not infrequent example of abandoning his
sect in order to adopt a creed sanctioned by the state.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>By way of aiding all this, and with the view of exasperating
still further religious animosities, the principal
Protestant clergy put forth a series of works,
which, for bitterness of feeling, have hardly ever been
equalled, and which it would certainly be impossible to
surpass. The intense hatred with which they regarded
their Catholic countrymen can only be fully estimated
by those who have looked into the pamphlets written
by the French Protestants during the first half of the
seventeenth century, or who have read the laboured
and formal treatises of such men as Chamier, Drelincourt,
Moulin, Thomson, and Vignier. Without, however,
pausing on these, it will perhaps be thought sufficient
if, for the sake of brevity, I follow the mere
outline of political events. Great numbers of the Protestants
had joined in the rebellion which, in 1615,
was raised by Condé;<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> and, although they were then
easily defeated, they seemed bent on trying the issue
of a fresh struggle. In Béarn, where they were unusually
numerous,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> they, even during the reign of
Henry IV., had refused to tolerate the Catholic religion;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
&lsquo;their fanatical clergy,&rsquo; says the historian of
France, &lsquo;declaring that it would be a crime to permit
the idolatry of the mass.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> This charitable maxim
they for many years actively enforced, seizing the
property of the Catholic clergy, and employing it in
support of their own churches;<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> so that, while in one
part of the dominions of the king of France the Protestants
were allowed to exercise their religion, they,
in another part of his dominions, prevented the Catholics
from exercising theirs. It was hardly to be
expected that any government would suffer such an
anomaly as this; and, in 1618, it was ordered that the
Protestants should restore the plunder, and reinstate
the Catholics in their former possessions. But the reformed
clergy, alarmed at so sacrilegious a proposal,
appointed a public fast, and inspiriting the people to
resistance, forced the royal commissioner to fly from
Pau, where he had arrived in the hope of effecting a
peaceful adjustment of the claims of the rival parties.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>The rebellion thus raised by the zeal of the Protestants,
was soon put down; but, according to the confession
of Rohan, one of the ablest of their leaders, it
was the beginning of all their misfortunes.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> The
sword had now been drawn; and the only question to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
be decided was, whether France should be governed
according to the principles of toleration recently established,
or according to the maxims of a despotic sect,
which, while professing to advocate the right of private
judgment, was acting in a way that rendered all private
judgment impossible.</p>

<p>Scarcely was the war in Béarn brought to an end,
when the Protestants determined on making a great
effort in the west of France.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> The seat of this new
struggle was Rochelle, which was one of the strongest
fortresses in Europe, and was entirely in the hands of
the Protestants,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> who had grown wealthy, partly by
their own industry and partly by following the occupation
of public pirates.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> In this city, which they
believed to be impregnable,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> they, in December, 1620,
held a Great Assembly, to which their spiritual chiefs
flocked from all parts of France. It was soon evident
that their party was now governed by men who were
bent on the most violent measures. Their great secular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
leaders were, as we have already seen, gradually falling
off; and, by this time, there only remained two of much
ability, Rohan and Mornay, both of whom saw the inexpediency
of their proceedings, and desired that the
assembly should peaceably separate.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> But the authority
of the clergy was irresistible; and, by their prayers
and exhortations, they easily gained over the ordinary
citizens, who were then a gross and uneducated body.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
Under their influence, the Assembly adopted a course
which rendered civil war inevitable. Their first act
was an edict, by which they at once confiscated all the
property belonging to Catholic churches.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> They then
caused a great seal to be struck; under the authority
of which they ordered that the people should be armed,
and taxes collected from them for the purpose of
defending their religion.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Finally, they drew up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
regulations, and organized the establishment of what
they called the Reformed Churches of France and of
Béarn; and, with a view to facilitate the exercise of
their spiritual jurisdiction, they parcelled out France
into eight circles, to each of which there was allotted
a separate general, who, however, was to be accompanied
by a clergyman, since the administration, in all
its parts, was held responsible to that ecclesiastical
assembly which called it into existence.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Such were the forms and pomp of authority assumed
by the spiritual leaders of the French Protestants; men
by nature destined to obscurity, and whose abilities were
so despicable, that, notwithstanding their temporary
importance, they have left no name in history. These
insignificant priests, who, at the best, were only fit to
mount the pulpit of a country village, now arrogated to
themselves the right of ordering the affairs of France,
imposing taxes upon Frenchmen, confiscating property,
raising troops, levying war; and all this for the sake of
propagating a creed, which was scouted by the country
at large as a foul and mischievous heresy.</p>

<p>In the face of these inordinate pretensions, it was
evident that the French government had no choice, except
to abdicate its functions, or else take arms in its
own defence.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Whatever may be the popular notion
respecting the necessary intolerance of the Catholics, it
is an indisputable fact, that, early in the seventeenth
century, they displayed in France a spirit of forbearance,
and a Christian charity, to which the Protestants
could make no pretence. During the twenty-two
years which elapsed between the Edict of Nantes and
the Assembly of Rochelle, the government, notwithstanding
repeated provocations, never attacked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Protestants;<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> nor did they make any attempt to destroy
the privileges of a sect, which they were bound to
consider heretical, and the extirpation of which had
been deemed by their fathers to be one of the first
duties of a Christian statesman.</p>

<p>The war that now broke out lasted seven years, and
was uninterrupted, except by the short peace, first of
Montpelier, and afterwards of Rochelle; neither of
which, however, was very strictly preserved. But the
difference in the views and intentions of the two parties
corresponded to the difference between the classes which
governed them. The Protestants, being influenced
mainly by the clergy, made their object religious domination.
The Catholics being led by statesmen, aimed
at temporal advantages. Thus it was, that circumstances
had in France so completely obliterated the
original tendency of these two great sects, that, by a
singular metamorphosis, the secular principle was now
represented by the Catholics, and the theological principle
by the Protestants. The authority of the clergy,
and therefore the interests of superstition, were upheld
by that very party which owed its origin to the
diminution of both; they were, on the other hand, attacked
by a party whose success had hitherto depended
on the increase of both. If the Catholics triumphed,
the ecclesiastical power would be weakened; if the
Protestants triumphed, it would be strengthened. Of
this fact, so far as the Protestants are concerned, I have
just given ample proof, collected from their proceedings,
and from the language of their own synods. And that
the opposite, or secular principle, predominated among
the Catholics, is evident, not only from their undeviating
policy in the reigns of Henry IV. and Louis XIII.,
but also from another circumstance worthy of note. For,
their motives were so obvious, and gave such scandal
to the church, that the pope, as the great protector of
religion, thought himself bound to reprehend that disregard
of theological interests which they displayed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and which he considered to be a crying and unpardonable
offence. In 1622, only one year after the struggle
between the Protestants and Catholics had begun, he
strongly remonstrated with the French government
upon the notorious indecency of which they were guilty,
in carrying on war against heretics, not for the purpose
of suppressing the heresy, but merely with a view of
procuring for the state those temporal advantages which,
in the opinion of all pious men, ought to be regarded
as of subordinate importance.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>If, at this juncture, the Protestants had carried the
day, the loss to France would have been immense, perhaps
irreparable. For no one, who is acquainted with
the temper and character of the French Calvinists,
can doubt, that if they had obtained possession of the
government, they would have revived those religious
persecutions which, so far as their power extended, they
had already attempted to enforce. Not only in their
writings, but even in the edicts of their assemblies, we
find ample proof of that meddling and intolerant spirit
which, in every age, has characterized ecclesiastical
legislation. Indeed, such a spirit is the legitimate consequence
of the fundamental assumption from which
theological lawgivers usually start. The clergy are
taught to consider that their paramount duty is to preserve
the purity of the faith, and guard it against the
invasions of heresy. Whenever, therefore, they rise to
power, it almost invariably happens, that they carry
into politics the habits they have contracted in their
profession; and having long been accustomed to consider
religious error as criminal, they now naturally
attempt to make it penal. And as all the European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
countries have, in the period of their ignorance, been
once ruled by the clergy, just so do we find in the law-books
of every land those traces of their power which
the progress of knowledge is gradually effacing. We
find the professors of the dominant creed enacting laws
against the professors of other creeds: laws sometimes
to burn them, sometimes to exile them, sometimes to
take away their civil rights, sometimes only to take
away their political rights. These are the different gradations
through which persecution passes; and by observing
which, we may measure, in any country, the
energy of the ecclesiastical spirit. At the same time,
the theory by which such measures are supported
generally gives rise to other measures of a somewhat
different, though of an analogous character. For, by
extending the authority of law to opinions as well as
to acts, the basis of legislation becomes dangerously
enlarged; the individuality and independence of each
man are invaded; and encouragement is given to the
enactment of intrusive and vexatious regulations, which
are supposed to perform for morals the service that the
other class of laws performs for religion. Under pretence
of favouring the practice of virtue, and maintaining
the purity of society, men are troubled in their most
ordinary pursuits, in the commonest occurrences of life,
in their amusements, nay, even in the very dress they
may be inclined to wear. That this is what has actually
been done, must be known to whoever has looked into
the writings of the fathers, into the canons of Christian
councils, into the different systems of ecclesiastical law,
or into the sermons of the earlier clergy. Indeed, all
this is so natural, that regulations, conceived in the same
spirit, were drawn up for the government of Geneva by
the Calvinist clergy, and for the government of England
by Archbishop Cranmer and his coadjutors; while a
tendency, precisely identical, may be observed in the
legislation of the Puritans, and to give a still later instance,
in that of the Methodists. It is, therefore, not
surprising that, in France, the Protestant clergy, having
great power among their own party, should enforce a
similar discipline. Thus, to mention only a few examples,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
they forbade any one to go to a theatre, or even
to witness the performance of private theatricals.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
They looked upon dancing as an ungodly amusement,
and, therefore, they not only strictly prohibited it, but
they ordered that all dancing-masters should be admonished
by the spiritual power, and desired to abandon
so unchristian a profession. If, however, the admonition
failed in effecting its purpose, the dancing-masters,
thus remaining obdurate, were to be excommunicated.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
With the same pious care did the clergy superintend
other matters equally important. In one of their
synods, they ordered that all persons should abstain
from wearing gay apparel, and should arrange
their hair with becoming modesty.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> In another
synod, they forbade women to paint; and they
declared that if, after this injunction, any woman
persisted in painting, she should not be allowed to receive
the sacrament.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> To their own clergy, as the
instructors and shepherds of the flock, there was paid
an attention still more scrupulous. The ministers of
the Word were permitted to teach Hebrew, because Hebrew
is a sacred dialect, uncontaminated by profane
writers. But the Greek language, which contains all
the philosophy and nearly all the wisdom of antiquity,
was to be discouraged, its study laid aside, its
professorship suppressed.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> And, in order that the
mind might not be distracted from spiritual things, the
study of chemistry was likewise forbidden; such a mere
earthly pursuit being incompatible with the habits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the sacred profession.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Lest, however, in spite of
these precautions, knowledge should still creep in among
the Protestants, other measures were taken to prevent
even its earliest approach. The clergy, entirely forgetting
that right of private judgment upon which their
sect was founded, became so anxious to protect the unwary
from error, that they forbade any person to print
or publish a work without the sanction of the church;
in other words, without the sanction of the clergy themselves.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
When, by these means, they had destroyed
the possibility of free inquiry, and, so far as they were
able, had put a stop to the acquisition of all real knowledge,
they proceeded to guard against another circumstance
to which their measures had given rise. For,
several of the Protestants, seeing that under such a
system, it was impossible to educate their families with
advantage, sent their children to some of those celebrated
Catholic colleges, where alone a sound education
could then be obtained. But the clergy, so soon as they
heard of this practice, put an end to it, by excommunicating
the offending parents;<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> and to this there was
added an order forbidding them to admit into their own
private houses any tutor who professed the Catholic
religion.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Such was the way in which the French
Protestants were watched over and protected by their
spiritual masters. Even the minutest matters were not
beneath the notice of these great legislators. They
ordered that no person should go to a ball or masquerade;<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
nor ought any Christian to look at the tricks
of conjurors, or at the famous game of goblets, or at
the puppet-show; neither was he to be present at morris-dances;
for all such amusements should be suppressed
by the magistrates, because they excite curiosity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
cause expense, waste time.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Another thing to be attended
to, is the names that are bestowed in baptism.
A child may have two christian names, though one is
preferable.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Great care, however, is to be observed
in their selection. They ought to be taken from the
Bible, but they ought not to be Baptist or Angel;
neither should any infant receive a name which has
been formerly used by the Pagans.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> When the children
are grown up, there are other regulations to which
they must be subject. The clergy declared that the
faithful must by no means let their hair grow long, lest
by so doing they indulge in the luxury of &lsquo;lascivious
curls.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> They are to make their garments in such a
manner as to avoid &lsquo;the new-fangled fashions of the
world:&rsquo; they are to have no tassels to their dress: their
gloves must be without silk and ribbons: they are to
abstain from fardingales: they are to beware of wide
sleeves.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Those readers who have not studied the history of
ecclesiastical legislation, will perhaps be surprised to
find, that men of gravity, men who had reached
the years of discretion, and were assembled together
in solemn council, should evince such a prying and
puerile spirit; that they should display such miserable
and childish imbecility. But, whoever will take
a wider survey of human affairs, will be inclined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
blame, not so much the legislators, as the system of
which the legislators formed a part. For as to the
men themselves, they merely acted after their kind.
They only followed the traditions in which they were
bred. By virtue of their profession, they had been
accustomed to hold certain views, and, when they rose
to power, it was natural that they should carry those
views into effect; thus transplanting into the law-book
the maxims they had already preached in the pulpit.
Whenever, therefore, we read of meddling, inquisitive,
and vexatious regulations imposed by ecclesiastical authority,
we should remember, that they are but the
legitimate result of the ecclesiastical spirit; and that
the way to remedy such grievances, or to prevent their
occurrence, is not by vainly labouring to change the
tendencies of that class from whence they proceed,
but rather by confining the class within its proper
limits, by jealously guarding against its earliest encroachments,
by taking every opportunity of lessening
its influence, and finally, when the progress of society
will justify so great a step, by depriving it of that political
and legislative power which, though gradually
falling from its hands, it is, even in the most civilized
countries, still allowed in some degree to retain.</p>

<p>But, setting aside these general considerations, it
will, at all events, be admitted, that I have collected
sufficient evidence to indicate what would have happened
to France, if the Protestants had obtained the
upper hand. After the facts which I have brought
forward, no one can possibly doubt, that if such a
misfortune had occurred, the liberal, and, considering
the age, the enlightened policy of Henry IV. and
Louis XIII. would have been destroyed, in order to
make way for that gloomy and austere system, which,
in every age and in every country, has been found
to be the natural fruit of ecclesiastical power. To
put, therefore, the question in its proper form, instead
of saying that there was a war between hostile
creeds, we should rather say that there was a war
between rival classes. It was a contest, not so much
between the Catholic religion and the Protestant religion,
as between Catholic laymen and Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
clergy. It was a struggle between temporal interests
and theological interests,&mdash;between the spirit of the
present and the spirit of the past. And the point now
at issue was, whether France should be governed by
the civil power or by the spiritual power,&mdash;whether
she should be ruled according to the large views of
secular statesmen, or according to the narrow notions
of a factious and intolerant priesthood.</p>

<p>The Protestants having the great advantage of being
the aggressive party, and being, moreover, inflamed by
a religious zeal unknown to their opponents, might,
under ordinary circumstances, have succeeded in their
hazardous attempt; or, at all events, they might have
protracted the struggle for an indefinite period. But, fortunately
for France, in 1624, only three years after the
war began, Richelieu assumed the direction of the government.
He had for some years been the secret adviser
of the queen-mother, into whose mind he had always
inculcated the necessity of complete toleration.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> When
placed at the head of affairs, he pursued the same
policy, and attempted in every way to conciliate the
Protestants. The clergy of his own party were constantly
urging him to exterminate the heretics, whose
presence they thought polluted France.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> But Richelieu,
having only secular objects, refused to embitter
the contest by turning it into a religious war. He was
determined to chastise the rebellion, but he would not
punish the heresy. Even while the war was raging,
he would not revoke those edicts of toleration by
which the full liberty of religious worship was granted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to the Protestants. And when they, in 1626, showed
signs of compunction, or at all events of fear, he publicly
confirmed the Edict of Nantes,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> and he granted
them peace; although, as he says, he knew that by
doing so he should fall under the suspicion of those &lsquo;who
so greatly affected the name of zealous Catholics.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
A few months afterwards, war again broke out; and
then it was that Richelieu determined on that celebrated
siege of Rochelle, which, if brought to a successful
issue, was sure to be a decisive blow against
the French Protestants. That he was moved to this
hazardous undertaking solely by secular considerations
is evident, not only from the general spirit of his preceding
policy, but also from his subsequent conduct.
With the details of this famous siege history is not
concerned, as such matters have no value except to military
readers. It is enough to say that, in 1628, Rochelle
was taken; and the Protestants, who had been induced
by their clergy<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> to continue to resist long after relief
was hopeless, and who, in consequence, had suffered the
most dreadful hardships, were obliged to surrender at
discretion.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> The privileges of the town were revoked,
and its magistrates removed; but the great minister
by whom these things were effected, still abstained from
that religious persecution to which he was urged.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
He granted to the Protestants the toleration which he
had offered at an earlier period, and he formally conceded
the free exercise of their public worship.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> But,
such was their infatuation, that because he likewise
restored the exercise of the Catholic religion, and thus
gave to the conquerors the same liberty that he had
granted to the conquered, the Protestants murmured
at the indulgence; they could not bear the idea that
their eyes should be offended by the performance of
Popish rites.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> And their indignation waxed so high,
that in the next year they, in another part of France,
again rose in arms. As, however, they were now
stripped of their principal resources, they were easily
defeated; and, their existence as a political faction
being destroyed, they were, in reference to their religion,
treated by Richelieu in the same manner as
before.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> To the Protestants generally, he confirmed
the privilege of preaching and of performing the other
ceremonies of their creed.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> To their leader, Rohan,
he granted an amnesty, and, a few years afterwards,
employed him in important public services. After this,
the hopes of the party were destroyed; they never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
again rose in arms, nor do we find any mention of them
until a much later period, when they were barbarously
persecuted by Louis XIV.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> But from all such intolerance
Richelieu sedulously abstained; and having
now cleared the land from rebellion, he embarked in
that vast scheme of foreign policy, of which I have
already given some account, and in which he clearly
showed that his proceedings against the Protestants
had not been caused by hatred of their religious tenets.
For, the same party which he attacked at home, he
supported abroad. He put down the French Protestants,
because they were a turbulent faction that troubled
the state, and wished to suppress the exercise of all
opinions unfavourable to themselves. But so far from
carrying on a crusade against their religion, he, as I
have already observed, encouraged it in other countries;
and, though a bishop of the Catholic church, he did
not hesitate, by treaties, by money, and by force of
arms, to support the Protestants against the House
of Austria, maintain the Lutherans against the Emperor
of Germany, and uphold the Calvinists against the
King of Spain.</p>

<p>I have thus endeavoured to draw a slight, though, I
trust, a clear outline, of the events which took place in
France during the reign of Louis XIII., and particularly
during that part of it which included the administration
of Richelieu. But such occurrences, important as they
are, only formed a single phase of that larger development
which was now displaying itself in nearly every
branch of the national intellect. They were the mere
political expression of that bold and sceptical spirit
which cried havoc to the prejudices and superstitions of
men. For, the government of Richelieu was successful,
as well as progressive; and no government can unite
these two qualities, unless its measures harmonize with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the feelings and temper of the age. Such an administration,
though it facilitates progress, is not the cause
of it, but is rather its measure and symptom. The cause
of the progress lies far deeper, and is governed by the
general tendency of the time. And as the different
tendencies observable in successive generations depend
on the difference in their knowledge, it is evident, that
we can only understand the working of the tendencies,
by taking a wide view of the amount and character of
the knowledge. To comprehend, therefore, the real
nature of the great advance made during the reign of
Louis XIII., it becomes necessary that I should lay before
the reader some evidence respecting those higher
and more important facts, which historians are apt to
neglect, but without which the study of the past is an
idle and trivial pursuit, and history itself a barren field,
which, bearing no fruit, is unworthy of the labour that
is wasted on the cultivation of so ungrateful a soil.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, a very observable fact, that while Richelieu,
with such extraordinary boldness, was secularizing
the whole system of French politics, and by his disregard
of ancient interests, was setting at naught the most
ancient traditions, a course precisely similar was being
pursued, in a still higher department, by a man greater
than he; by one, who, if I may express my own opinion,
is the most profound among the many eminent thinkers
France has produced. I speak of Réné Descartes, of
whom the least that can be said is, that he effected a
revolution more decisive than has ever been brought
about by any other single mind. With his mere physical
discoveries we are not now concerned, because in
this Introduction I do not pretend to trace the progress
of science, except in those epochs which indicate a new
turn in the habits of national thought. But I may
remind the reader, that he was the first who successfully
applied algebra to geometry;<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> that he pointed out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
important law of the sines;<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> that in an age in which
optical instruments were extremely imperfect, he discovered
the changes to which light is subjected in the
eye by the crystalline lens;<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> that he directed attention
to the consequences resulting from the weight of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
atmosphere;<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> and that he, moreover, detected the
causes of the rainbow,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> that singular phenomenon, with
which, in the eyes of the vulgar, some theological superstitions
are still connected.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> At the same time, and
as if to combine the most varied forms of excellence,
he is not only allowed to be the first geometrician of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
age,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> but by the clearness and admirable precision of
his style, he became one of the founders of French
prose.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> And although he was constantly engaged in
those lofty inquiries into the nature of the human mind,
which can never be studied without wonder, I had
almost said can never be read without awe, he combined
with them a long course of laborious experiment upon
the animal frame, which raised him to the highest rank
among the anatomists of his time.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The great discovery
made by Harvey of the circulation of the blood,
was neglected by most of his contemporaries;<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
was at once recognized by Descartes, who made it the
basis of the physiological part of his work on Man.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
He likewise adopted the discovery of the lacteals by
Aselli,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> which, like every great truth yet laid before
the world, was, at its first appearance, not only disbelieved,
but covered with ridicule.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>These things might have been sufficient to rescue
even the physical labours of Descartes from the attacks
constantly made on them by men who either have not
studied his works, or else, having studied them, are
unable to understand their merit. But the glory of
Descartes, and the influence he exercised over his age,
do not depend even on such claims as these. Putting
them aside, he is the author of what is emphatically
called Modern Philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> He is the originator of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
that great system and method of metaphysics, which,
notwithstanding its errors, has the undoubted merit of
having given a wonderful impulse to the European
mind, and communicated to it an activity which has
been made available for other purposes of a different
character. Besides this, and superior to it, there is
another obligation which we are under to the memory
of Descartes. He deserves the gratitude of posterity,
not so much on account of what he built up, as on
account of what he pulled down. His life was one great
and successful warfare against the prejudices and traditions
of men. He was great as a creator, but he was
far greater as a destroyer. In this respect he was the
true successor of Luther, to whose labours his own were
the fitting supplement. He completed what the great
German reformer had left undone.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> He bore to the old
systems of philosophy precisely the same relation that
Luther bore to the old systems of religion. He was
the great reformer and liberator of the European intellect.
To prefer, therefore, even the most successful
discoverers of physical laws to this great innovator and
disturber of tradition, is just as if we should prefer
knowledge to freedom, and believe that science is better
than liberty. We must, indeed, always be grateful to
those eminent thinkers, to whose labours we are indebted
for that vast body of physical truths which we
now possess. But, let us reserve the full measure of
our homage for those far greater men, who have not
hesitated to attack and destroy the most inveterate
prejudices: men who, by removing the pressure of tradition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
have purified the very source and fountain of
our knowledge, and secured its future progress, by
casting off obstacles in the presence of which progress
was impossible.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>It will not be expected, perhaps it will hardly be
desired, that I should enter into a complete detail of the
philosophy of Descartes: a philosophy which, in England
at least, is rarely studied, and therefore, is often
attacked. But it will be necessary to give such an
account of it as will show its analogy with the anti-theological
policy of Richelieu, and will thus enable us to
see the full extent of that vast movement which took
place in France before the accession of Louis XIV. By
this means, we shall be able to understand how the
daring innovations of the great minister were so successful,
since they were accompanied and reinforced by
corresponding innovations in the national intellect;
thus affording an additional instance of the way in
which the political history of every country is to be
explained by the history of its intellectual progress.</p>

<p>In 1637, when Richelieu was at the height of his
power, Descartes published that great work which he
had long been meditating, and which was the first open
announcement of the new tendencies of the French
mind. To this work he gave the name of a &lsquo;Method;&rsquo;
and, assuredly, the method is the most alien to what is
commonly called theology that can possibly be conceived.
Indeed, so far from being theological, it is essentially
and exclusively psychological. The theological method
rests on ancient records, on tradition, on the voice of
antiquity. The method of Descartes rests solely on the
consciousness each man has of the operations of his own
mind, and lest anyone should mistake the meaning of
this, he, in subsequent works, developed it at great
length, and with unrivalled clearness. For his main
object was to popularize the views which he put forward.
Therefore, says Descartes, &lsquo;I write in French rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
than in Latin, because I trust that they who only employ
their simple and native reason will estimate my opinions
more fairly than they who only believe in ancient
books.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> So strongly does he insist upon this, that,
almost at the beginning of his first work, he cautions
his readers against the common error of looking to
antiquity for knowledge; and he reminds them that
&lsquo;when men are too curious to know the practices of past
ages, they generally remain very ignorant of their
own.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, so far from following the old plan of searching
for truths in the records of the past, the great
essential of this new philosophy is to wean ourselves
from all such associations, and, beginning the acquisition
of knowledge by the work of destruction, first pull
down, in order that afterwards we may build up.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
When I, says Descartes, set forth in the pursuit of truth,
I found that the best way was to reject every thing I had
hitherto received, and pluck out all my old opinions, in
order that I might lay the foundation of them afresh:
believing that, by this means, I should more easily
accomplish the great scheme of life, than by building on
an old basis, and supporting myself by principles which
I had learned in my youth, without examining if they
were really true.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> &lsquo;I, therefore, will occupy myself
freely and earnestly in effecting a general destruction of
all my old opinions.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> For, if we would know all the
truths that can be known, we must, in the first place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
free ourselves from our prejudices, and make a point
of rejecting those things which we have received, until
we have subjected them to a new examination.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> We,
therefore, must derive our opinions, not from tradition,
but from ourselves. We must not pass judgment upon
any subject which we do not clearly and distinctly
understand; for, even if such a judgment is correct, it
can only be so by accident, not having solid ground on
which to support itself.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> But, so far are we from this
state of indifference, that our memory is full of prejudices:<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
we pay attention to words rather than to
things;<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> and being thus slaves to form, there are too
many of us &lsquo;who believe themselves religious, when, in
fact, they are bigoted and superstitious; who think
themselves perfect because they go much to church,
because they often repeat prayers, because they wear
short hair, because they fast, because they give alms.
These are the men who imagine themselves such friends
of God, that nothing they do displeases Him; men who,
under pretence of zeal, gratify their passions by committing
the greatest crimes, such as betraying towns,
killing princes, exterminating nations: and all this they
do to those who will not change their opinions.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>These were the words of wisdom which this great
teacher addressed to his countrymen only a few years
after they had brought to a close the last religious war
that has ever been waged in France. The similarity of
those views to those which, about the same time, were
put forth by Chillingworth, must strike every reader,
but ought not to excite surprise; for they were but the
natural products of a state of society in which the right
of private judgment, and the independence of the
human reason, were first solidly established. If we
examine this matter a little closer, we shall find still
further proof of the analogy between France and England.
So identical are the steps of the progress, that
the relation which Montaigne bears to Descartes is just
the same as that which Hooker bears to Chillingworth;
the same in reference to the difference of time, and
also in reference to the difference of opinions. The
mind of Hooker was essentially sceptical; but his
genius was so restrained by the prejudices of his age,
that, unable to discern the supreme authority of private
judgment, he hampered it by appeals to councils and
to the general voice of ecclesiastical antiquity: impediments
which Chillingworth, thirty years later, effectually
removed. In precisely the same way, Montaigne, like
Hooker, was sceptical; but, like him, he lived at a
period when the spirit of doubt was yet young, and
when the mind still trembled before the authority of
the Church. It is, therefore, no wonder that even Montaigne,
who did so much for his age, should have hesitated
respecting the capacity of men to work out for
themselves great truths; and that, pausing in the
course that lay before him, his scepticism should often
have assumed the form of a distrust of the human
faculties.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Such shortcomings, and such imperfections,
are merely an evidence of the slow growth of
society, and of the impossibility for even the greatest
thinkers to outstrip their contemporaries beyond a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
certain point. But, with the advance of knowledge,
this deficiency was at length supplied; and, as the
generation after Hooker brought forth Chillingworth,
just so did the generation after Montaigne bring forth
Descartes. Both Chillingworth and Descartes were
eminently sceptical; but their scepticism was directed,
not against the human intellect, but against those
appeals to authority and tradition without which it had
hitherto been supposed that the intellect could not
safely proceed. That this was the case with Chillingworth,
we have already seen. That it was likewise the
case with Descartes, is, if possible, still more apparent;
for that profound thinker believed, not only that the
mind, by its own efforts, could root out its most ancient
opinions, but that it could, without fresh aid, build up
a new and solid system in place of the one which it had
thrown down.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>It is this extraordinary confidence in the power of
the human intellect, which eminently characterizes
Descartes, and has given to his philosophy that peculiar
sublimity which distinguishes it from all other systems.
So far from thinking that a knowledge of the external
world is essential to the discovery of truth, he laid it
down as a fundamental principle, that we must begin
by ignoring such knowledge;<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> that the first step is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
separate ourselves from the delusions of nature, and
reject the evidence presented to our senses.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> For,
says Descartes, nothing is certain but thought; nor are
there any truths except those which necessarily follow
from the operation of our own consciousness. We
have no knowledge of our soul except as a thinking
substance:<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> and it were easier for us to believe that
the soul should cease to exist, than that it should cease
to think.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> And, as to man himself, what is he but
the incarnation of thought? For that which constitutes
the man, is not his bones, nor his flesh, nor his
blood. These are the accidents, the incumbrances, the
impediments of his nature. But the man himself is the
thought. The invisible me, the ultimate fact of existence,
the mystery of life, is this: &lsquo;I am a thing that
thinks.&rsquo; This, therefore, is the beginning and the
basis of our knowledge. The thought of each man is
the last element to which analysis can carry us; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the supreme judge of every doubt; it is the starting-point
for all wisdom.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>Taking our stand on this ground, we rise, says Descartes,
to the perception of the existence of the Deity.
For, our belief in His existence is an irrefragable proof
that He exists. Otherwise, whence does the belief arise?
Since nothing can come out of nothing, and since no effect
can be without a cause, it follows that the idea we have
of God must have an origin; and this origin, whatever
name we give it, is no other than God.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Thus, the
ultimate proof of His existence is our idea of it. Instead,
therefore, of saying that we know ourselves
because we believe in God, we should rather say that
we believe in God because we know ourselves.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> This
is the order and precedence of things. The thought of
each man is sufficient to prove His existence, and it is
the only proof we can ever possess. Such, therefore,
is the dignity and supremacy of the human intellect,
that even this, the highest of all matters, flows from it,
as from its sole source.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Hence, our religion should
not be acquired by the teaching of others, but should
be worked out by ourselves: it is not to be borrowed
from antiquity, but it is to be discovered by each man's
mind; it is not traditional, but personal. It is because
this great truth has been neglected, that impiety has
arisen. If each man were to content himself with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
idea of God which is suggested by his own mind, he
would attain to a true knowledge of the Divine Nature.
But when, instead of confining himself to this, he
mixes up with it the notions of others, his ideas become
perplexed; they contradict themselves; and the composition
being thus confused, he often ends by denying
the existence, not, indeed, of God, but of such a God
as that in whom he has been taught to believe.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>The mischief which these principles must have done
to the old theology is very obvious.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Not only were
they fatal, in the minds of those who received them, to
many of the common dogmas&mdash;such, for instance, as
that of transubstantiation,<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>&mdash;but they were likewise
directly opposed to other opinions, equally indefensible,
and far more dangerous. For Descartes, by founding
a philosophy which rejected all authority except that of
the human reason,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> was, of course, led to abandon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
study of final causes,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>&mdash;an old and natural superstition,
by which, as we shall hereafter see, the German
philosophers were long impeded, and which still hangs,
though somewhat loosely, about the minds of men.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
At the same time, by superseding the geometry of the
ancients, he aided in weakening that inordinate respect
with which antiquity was then regarded. In another
matter, still more important, he displayed the same
spirit, and met with the same success. With such
energy did he attack the influence, or rather the
tyranny of Aristotle, that although the opinions of that
philosopher were intimately interwoven with the Christian
theology,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> his authority was entirely overthrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
by Descartes; and with it there perished those scholastic
prejudices, for which Aristotle, indeed, was not
responsible, but which, under the shelter of his mighty
name, had, during several centuries, perplexed the understandings
of men, and retarded the progress of their
knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>These were the principal services rendered to civilization
by one of the greatest men Europe has ever produced.
The analogy between him and Richelieu is very
striking, and is as complete as their relative positions
would allow. The same disregard of ancient notions,
the same contempt for theological interests, the same
indifference to tradition, the same determination to
prefer the present to the past: in a word, the same
essentially modern spirit, is seen alike in the writings
of Descartes, and in the actions of Richelieu. What
the first was to philosophy, that was the other to
politics. But, while acknowledging the merits of these
eminent men, it behoves us to remember that their
success was the result, not only of their own abilities,
but likewise of the general temper of their time. The
nature of their labours depended on themselves; the
way in which their labours were received, depended on
their contemporaries. Had they lived in a more superstitious
age, their views would have been disregarded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
or, if noticed, would have been execrated as impious
novelties. In the fifteenth, or early in the sixteenth
century, the genius of Descartes and of Richelieu would
have lacked the materials necessary to their work; their
comprehensive minds would, in that state of society,
have found no play; they would have awakened no
sympathies; their bread would have been cast upon
those waters which return it not again. And it would
have been well for them if, in such a case, indifference
were the only penalty with which they would be visited.
It would have been well if they had not paid the forfeit
incurred by many of those illustrious thinkers who
have vainly attempted to stem the torrent of human
credulity. It would have been well if the church had
not risen in her wrath&mdash;if Richelieu had not been
executed as a traitor, and Descartes burned as a heretic.</p>

<p>Indeed, the mere fact that two such men, occupying so
conspicuous a place before the public eye, and enforcing
views so obnoxious to the interests of superstition,
should have lived without serious danger, and then
have died peaceably in their beds&mdash;the mere fact that
this should have happened, is a decisive proof of the
progress which, during fifty years, had been made by
the French nation. With such rapidity were the prejudices
of that great people dying away, that opinions
utterly subversive of theological traditions, and fatal to
the whole scheme of ecclesiastical power, were with impunity
advocated by Descartes, and put in practice by
Richelieu. It was now clearly seen, that the two foremost
men of their time could, with little or no risk,
openly propagate ideas which, half a century before,
it would have been accounted dangerous even for the
most obscure man to whisper in the privacy of his own
chamber.</p>

<p>Nor are the causes of this impunity difficult to understand.
They are to be found in the diffusion of that
sceptical spirit, by which, in France as well as in England,
toleration was preceded. For, without entering
into details which would be too long for the limits of
this Introduction, it is enough to say, that French
literature generally was, at this period, distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
by a freedom and a boldness of inquiry, of which, England
alone excepted, no example had then been seen
in Europe. The generation which had listened to the
teachings of Montaigne and of Charron, was now succeeded
by another generation, the disciples, indeed, of
those eminent men, but disciples who far outstripped
their masters. The result was, that, during the thirty
or forty years which preceded the power of Louis
XIV.,<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> there was not to be found a single Frenchman
of note who did not share in the general feeling&mdash;not
one who did not attack some ancient dogma, or sap
the foundation of some old opinion. This fearless
temper was the characteristic of the ablest writers of
that time;<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> but what is still more observable is, that
the movement spread with such rapidity as to include
in its action even those parts of society which are invariably
the last to be affected by it. That spirit of
doubt, which is the necessary precursor of all inquiry,
and therefore of all solid improvement, owes its origin
to the most thinking and intellectual parts of
society, and is naturally opposed by the other parts:
opposed by the nobles, because it is dangerous to their
interests; opposed by the uneducated, because it
attacks their prejudices. This is one of the reasons
why neither the highest nor the lowest ranks are
fit to conduct the government of a civilized country;
since both of them, notwithstanding individual
exceptions, are, in the aggregate, averse to those
reforms which the exigencies of an advancing nation
constantly require. But, in France, before the middle
of the seventeenth century, even these classes began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to participate in the great progress; so that, not
only among thoughtful men, but likewise among the
ignorant and the frivolous, there was seen that inquisitive
and incredulous disposition, which, whatever
may be said against it, has at least this peculiarity,
that, in its absence, there is no instance to be found of
the establishment of those principles of toleration and
of liberty, which have only been recognized with infinite
difficulty, and after many a hard-fought battle
against prejudices whose inveterate tenacity might
almost cause them to be deemed a part of the original
constitution of the human mind.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>It is no wonder if, under these circumstances, the
speculations of Descartes and the actions of Richelieu
should have met with great success. The system of
Descartes exercised immense influence, and soon pervaded
nearly every branch of knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> The policy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of Richelieu was so firmly established, that it was continued
without the slightest difficulty by his immediate
successor: nor was any attempt made to reverse it
until that forcible and artificial reaction which, under
Louis XIV., was fatal, for a time, to every sort of civil
and religious liberty. The history of that reaction,
and the way in which, by a counter-reaction, the French
Revolution was prepared, will be related in the subsequent
chapters of this volume; at present we will
resume the thread of those events which took place in
France before Louis XIV. assumed the government.</p>

<p>A few months after the death of Richelieu, Louis
XIII. also died, and the crown was inherited by Louis
XIV., who was then a child, and who for many years
had no influence in public affairs. During his minority,
the government was administered, avowedly by his
mother, but in reality by Mazarin: a man who, though
in every point inferior to Richelieu, had imbibed something
of his spirit, and who, so far as he was able,
adopted the policy of that great statesman, to whom he
owed his promotion.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> He, influenced partly by the
example of his predecessor, partly by his own character,
and partly by the spirit of his age, showed no
desire to persecute the Protestants, or to disturb them
in any of the rights they then exercised.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> His first
act was to confirm the Edict of Nantes;<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> and, towards
the close of his life, he even allowed the Protestants
again to hold those synods which their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
violence had been the means of interrupting.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Between
the death of Richelieu and the accession to
power of Louis XIV., there elapsed a period of nearly
twenty years, during which Mazarin, with the exception
of a few intervals, was at the head of the state;
and in the whole of that time, I have found no instance
of any Frenchman being punished for his religion.
Indeed, the new government, so far from protecting the
church by repressing heresy, displayed that indifference
to ecclesiastical interests which was now becoming
a settled maxim of French policy. Richelieu,
as we have already seen, had taken the bold step of
placing Protestants at the head of the royal armies;
and this he had done upon the simple principle, that
one of the first duties of a statesman is to employ for
the benefit of the country the ablest men he can find,
without regard to their theological opinions, with which,
as he well knew, no government has any concern. But
Louis XIII., whose personal feelings were always opposed
to the enlightened measures of his great minister,
was offended by this magnanimous disregard of ancient
prejudices; his piety was shocked at the idea of Catholic
soldiers being commanded by heretics; and, as
we are assured by a well-informed contemporary, he
determined to put an end to this scandal to the church,
and, for the future, allow no Protestant to receive
the staff of marshal of France.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Whether the king, if
he had lived, would have carried his point, is doubtful;<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
but what is certain is, that, only four months after his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
death, this appointment of marshal was bestowed upon
Turenne, the most able of all the Protestant generals.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
And in the very next year, Gassion, another Protestant,
was raised to the same dignity; thus affording the
strange spectacle of the highest military power in a
great Catholic country wielded by two men against
whose religion the church was never weary of directing
her anathemas.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> In a similar spirit, Mazarin, on
mere grounds of political expediency, concluded an
intimate alliance with Cromwell; an usurper who, in
the opinion of the theologians, was doomed to perdition,
since he was soiled by the triple crime of rebellion,
of heresy, and of regicide.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Finally, one of the
last acts of this pupil of Richelieu's<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> was to sign the
celebrated treaty of the Pyrenees, by which ecclesiastical
interests were seriously weakened, and great injury
inflicted on him who was still considered to be the
head of the church.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>But, the circumstance for which the administration
of Mazarin is most remarkable, is the breaking out of
that great civil war called the Fronde, in which the
people attempted to carry into politics the insubordinate
spirit which had already displayed itself in
literature and in religion. Here we cannot fail to note
the similarity between this struggle and that which, at
the same time, was taking place in England. It would,
indeed, be far from accurate to say that the two events
were the counterpart of each other; but there can be
no doubt that the analogy between them is very striking.
In both countries, the civil war was the first
popular expression of what had hitherto been rather
a speculative, and, so to say, a literary scepticism. In
both countries, incredulity was followed by rebellion,
and the abasement of the clergy preceded the humiliation
of the crown; for Richelieu was to the French
church what Elizabeth had been to the English church.
In both countries there now first arose that great product
of civilization, a free press, which showed its
liberty by pouring forth those fearless and innumerable
works which mark the activity of the age.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> In both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
countries, the struggle was between retrogression and
progress; between those who clung to tradition, and
those who longed for innovation; while, in both, the
contest assumed the external form of a war between
king and parliament, the king being the organ of the
past, the parliament the representative of the present.
And, not to mention inferior similarities, there was one
other point of vast importance in which these two
great events coincide. This is, that both of them were
eminently secular, and arose from the desire, not of
propagating religious opinions, but of securing civil
liberty. The temporal character of the English rebellion
I have already noticed, and, indeed, it must be
obvious to whoever has studied the evidence in its
original sources. In France, not only do we find the
same result, but we can even mark the stages of the
progress. In the middle of the sixteenth century, and
immediately after the death of Henry III., the French
civil wars were caused by religious disputes, and were
carried on with the fervour of a crusade. Early in
the seventeenth century, hostilities again broke out;
but though the efforts of the government were directed
against the Protestants, this was not because
they were heretics, but because they were rebels: the
object being, not to punish an opinion, but to control a
faction. This was the first great stage in the history
of toleration; and it was accomplished, as we have
already seen, during the reign of Louis XIII. That
generation passing away, there arose, in the next age,
the wars of the Fronde; and in this, which may be
called the second stage of the French intellect, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
alteration was still more remarkable. For, in the mean
time, the principles of the great sceptical thinkers,
from Montaigne to Descartes, had produced their natural
fruit, and, becoming diffused among the educated
classes, had influenced, as they always will do, not only
those by whom they were received, but also those by
whom they were rejected. Indeed, a mere knowledge
of the fact, that the most eminent men have thrown
doubt on the popular opinions of an age, can never
fail, in some degree, to disturb the convictions even of
those by whom the doubts are ridiculed.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> In such
cases, none are entirely safe: the firmest belief is apt
to become slightly unsettled; those who outwardly preserve
the appearance of orthodoxy, often unconsciously
waver; they cannot entirely resist the influence of superior
minds, nor can they always avoid an unwelcome
suspicion, that when ability is on one side, and ignorance
on the other, it is barely possible that the ability
may be right, and the ignorance may be wrong.</p>

<p>Thus it fell out in France. In that country, as in
every other, when theological convictions diminished,
theological animosities subsided. Formerly religion had
been the cause of war, and had also been the pretext
under which it was conducted. Then there came a
time when it ceased to be the cause: but so slow is the
progress of society, that it was still found necessary to
set it up as the pretext.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Finally, there came the
great days of the Fronde, in which it was neither cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
nor pretext,<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> and in which there was seen, for the
first time in France, an arduous struggle by human
beings avowedly for human purposes: a war waged
by men who sought, not to enforce their opinions, but
to increase their liberty. And, as if to make this
change still more striking, the most eminent leader of
the insurgents was the Cardinal de Retz; a man of
vast ability, but whose contempt for his profession was
notorious,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> and of whom a great historian has said,
&lsquo;he is the first bishop in France who carried on a civil
war without making religion the pretence.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>We have thus seen that, during the seventy years
which succeeded the accession of Henry IV., the
French intellect developed itself in a manner remarkably
similar to that which took place in England. We
have seen that, in both countries, the mind, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to the natural conditions of its growth, first doubted
what it had long believed, and then tolerated what it
had long hated. That this was by no means an accidental
or capricious combination, is evident, not only
from general arguments, and from the analogy of the
two countries, but also from another circumstance of
great interest. This is, that the order of events, and as
it were their relative proportions, were the same, not
only in reference to the increase of toleration, but also
in reference to the increase of literature and science.
In both countries, the progress of knowledge bore
the same ratio to the decline of ecclesiastical influence,
although they manifested that ratio at different periods.
We had begun to throw off our superstitions somewhat
earlier than the French were able to do; and thus,
being the first in the field, we anticipated that great
people in producing a secular literature. Whoever will
take the pains to compare the growth of the French
and English minds, will see that, in all the most important
departments, we were the first, I do not say in
merit, but in the order of time. In prose, in poetry,
and in every branch of intellectual excellence, it will
be found, on comparison, that we were before the
French nearly a whole generation; and that, chronologically,
the same proportion was preserved as that
between Bacon and Descartes, Hooker and Pascal,<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
Shakespeare and Corneille, Massinger and Racine, Ben
Jonson and Molière, Harvey and Pecquet. These eminent
men were all justly celebrated in their respective
countries; and it would perhaps be invidious to institute
a comparison between them. But what we have
here to observe is, that among those who cultivated the
same department, the greatest Englishman, in every
instance, preceded the greatest Frenchman by many
years. The difference, running as it does, through all
the leading topics, is far too regular to be considered
accidental. And as few Englishmen of the present day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
will be so presumptuous as to suppose that we possess
any native and inherent superiority over the French,
it is evident that there must be some marked peculiarity
in which the two countries differed, and which
has produced this difference, not in their knowledge,
but in the time at which their knowledge appeared.
Nor does the discovery of this peculiarity require
much penetration. For, notwithstanding that the
French were more tardy than the English, still, when
the development had fairly begun, the antecedents
of its success were among both people precisely the
same. It is, therefore, clear, according to the commonest
principles of inductive reasoning, that the lateness
of the development must be owing to the lateness
of the antecedent. It is clear that the French
knew less because they believed more.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> It is clear
that their progress was checked by the prevalence of
those feelings which are fatal to all knowledge, because,
looking on antiquity as the sole receptacle of wisdom,
they degrade the present in order that they may exaggerate
the past: feelings which destroy the prospects
of man, stifle his hopes, damp his curiosity, chill his
energies, impair his judgment, and, under pretence of
humbling the pride of his reason, seek to throw him
back into that more than midnight darkness from which
his reason alone has enabled him to emerge.</p>

<p>The analogy thus existing between France and England,
is, indeed, very striking, and, so far as we have
yet considered it, seems complete in all its parts. To
sum up the similarities in a few words, it may be
said, that both countries followed the same order of
development in their scepticism, in their knowledge,
in their literature, and in their toleration. In both
countries, there broke out a civil war at the same
time, for the same object, and, in many respects, under
the same circumstances. In both, the insurgents, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
first triumphant, were afterwards defeated; and the
rebellion being put down, the governments of the two
nations were fully restored almost at the same moment:
in 1660 by Charles II.; in 1661, by Louis XIV.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> But
there the similarity stopped. At this point there began
a marked divergence between the two countries;<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
which continued to increase for more than a century,
until it ended in England by the consolidation of the
national prosperity, in France by a revolution more
sanguinary, more complete, and more destructive, than
any the world has ever seen. This difference between
the fortunes of such great and civilized nations is so
remarkable, that a knowledge of its causes becomes
essential to a right understanding of European history,
and will be found to throw considerable light on other
events not immediately connected with it. Besides
this, such an inquiry, independently of its scientific
interest, will have a high practical value. It will show,
what men seem only recently to have begun to understand,
that, in politics, no certain principles having
yet been discovered, the first conditions of success are
compromise, barter, expediency, and concession. It
will show the utter helplessness even of the ablest
rulers, when they try to meet new emergencies by old
maxims. It will show the intimate connexion between
knowledge and liberty; between an increasing civilization
and an advancing democracy. It will show
that, for a progressive nation, there is required a progressive
polity; that within certain limits, innovation
is the sole ground of security; that no institution can
withstand the flux and movements of society, unless it
not only repairs its structure, but also widens its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
entrance; and that, even in a material point of view,
no country can long remain either prosperous or safe,
in which the people are not gradually extending their
power, enlarging their privileges, and, so to say, incorporating
themselves with the functions of the state.</p>

<p>The tranquillity of England, and her freedom from
civil war, are to be ascribed to the recognition of these
great truths;<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> while the neglect of them has entailed
upon other countries the most woful calamities. On
this account, therefore, if on no other, it becomes interesting
to ascertain how it was that the two nations
we have been comparing should, in regard to these
truths, have adopted views diametrically opposite, although,
in other matters, their opinions, as we have
already seen, were very similar. Or, to state the question
in other words, we have to inquire how it was that
the French, after pursuing precisely the same course
as the English, in their knowledge, in their scepticism,
and in their toleration, should have stopped short in
their politics; how it was that their minds, which had
effected such great things, should, nevertheless, have
been so unprepared for liberty, that, in spite of the
heroic efforts of the Fronde, they not only fell under
the despotism of Louis XIV., but never cared to resist
it; and, at length, becoming slaves in their souls as
well as in their bodies, they grew proud of a condition
which the meanest Englishman would have spurned as
an intolerable bondage.</p>

<p>The cause of this difference is to be sought in the
existence of that spirit of protection which is so dangerous
and yet so plausible, that it forms the most serious
obstacle with which advancing civilization has to contend.
This, which may truly be called an evil spirit,
has always been far stronger in France than in England.
Indeed, among the French, it continues, even
to the present day, to produce the most mischievous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
results. It is, as I shall hereafter point out, intimately
connected with that love of centralization which
appears in the machinery of their government, and in
the spirit of their literature. It is this which induces
them to retain restrictions by which their trade has
long been troubled, and to preserve monopolies which,
in our country, a freer system has effectually destroyed.
It is this which causes them to interfere with the
natural relation between producers and consumers; to
force into existence manufactures which otherwise
would never arise, and which, for that very reason, are
not required; to disturb the ordinary march of industry,
and, under pretence of protecting their native
labourers, diminish the produce of labour by diverting
it from those profitable channels into which its own
instincts always compel it to flow.</p>

<p>When the protective principle is carried into trade,
these are its inevitable results. When it is carried into
politics, there is formed what is called a paternal government,
in which supreme power is vested in the
sovereign, or in a few privileged classes. When it is
carried into theology, it produces a powerful church,
and a numerous clergy, who are supposed to be the necessary
guardians of religion, and every opposition to
whom is resented as an insult to the public morals.
These are the marks by which protection may be recognized;
and from a very early period they have displayed
themselves in France much more clearly than in England.
Without pretending to discover their precise origin, I
will, in the next chapter, endeavour to trace them back
to a time sufficiently remote to explain some of the discrepancies
which, in this respect existed between the
two countries.</p>

<hr class="hr65" />

<p><i>Note to p</i>. <a href="#Page_93">93</a>.<span style="font-size: 0.9em;">Descartes died in Sweden on a visit to Christina;
so that, strictly speaking, there is an error in the text. But this
does not affect the argument; because the works of Descartes, being
eagerly read in France, and not being prohibited, we must suppose
that his person would have been safe, had he remained in his own
country. To burn a heretic is a more decisive step than to suppress
a book; and as the French clergy were not strong enough to effect
the latter, it is hardly likely that they could have accomplished the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The question as to whether the study of normal phenomena
should or should not precede the study of abnormal ones, is of the
greatest importance; and a neglect of it has introduced confusion into
every work I have seen on general or comparative history. For this
preliminary being unsettled, there has been no recognized principle of
arrangement; and historians, instead of following a scientific method
suited to the actual exigencies of our knowledge, have adopted an
empirical method suited to their own exigencies; and have given priority
to different countries, sometimes according to their size, sometimes
according to their antiquity, sometimes according to their geographical
position, sometimes according to their wealth, sometimes according to
their religion, sometimes according to the brilliancy of their
literature, and sometimes according to the facilities which the
historian himself possessed for collecting materials. All these are
factitious considerations; and, in a philosophic view, it is evident
that precedence should be given to countries by the historian solely in
reference to the ease with which their history can be generalized;
following in this respect the scientific plan of proceeding from the
simple to the complex. This leads us to the conclusion that, in the
study of Man, as in the study of Nature, the question of priority
resolves itself into a question of aberration; and that the more
aberrant any people have been, that is to say, the more they have been
interfered with, the lower they must be placed in an arrangement of the
history of various countries. Coleridge (<i>Lit. Remains</i>, vol. i. p. 326,
and elsewhere in his works) seems to suppose that the order should be
the reverse of what I have stated, and that the laws both of mind and
body can be generalized from pathological data. Without wishing to
express myself too positively in opposition to so profound a thinker as
Coleridge, I cannot help saying that this is contradicted by an immense
amount of evidence, and, so far as I am aware, is supported by none. It
is contradicted by the fact, that those branches of inquiry which deal
with phenomena little affected by foreign causes, have been raised to
sciences sooner than those which deal with phenomena greatly affected by
foreign causes. The organic world, for example, is more perturbed by the
inorganic world, than the inorganic world is perturbed by it. Hence we
find that the inorganic sciences have always been cultivated before the
organic ones, and at the present moment are far more advanced than they.
In the same way, human physiology is older than human pathology; and
while the physiology of the vegetable kingdom has been successfully
prosecuted since the latter half of the seventeenth century, the
pathology of the vegetable kingdom can scarcely be said to exist, since
none of its laws have been generalized, and no systematic researches, on
a large scale, have yet been made into the morbid anatomy of plants. It
appears, therefore, that different ages and different sciences bear
unconscious testimony to the uselessness of paying much attention to the
abnormal, until considerable progress has been made in the study of the
normal; and this conclusion might be confirmed by innumerable
authorities, who, differing from Coleridge, hold that physiology is the
basis of pathology, and that the laws of disease are to be raised, not
from the phenomena presented in disease, but from those presented in
health; in other words, that pathology should be investigated
deductively rather than inductively, and that morbid anatomy and
clinical observations may verify the conclusions of science, but can
never supply the means of creating the science itself. On this extremely
interesting question, compare <i>Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire</i>, <i>Hist. des
Anomalies de l'Organisation</i>, vol. ii. pp. 9, 10, 127; <i>Bowman's
Surgery</i>, in <i>Encyclop. of the Medical Sciences</i>, p. 824; <i>Bichat</i>,

Lectures on Man</i>, 1844, p. 45; <i>Simon's Pathology</i>, p. 5.</p>

<p>Another confirmation of the accuracy of this view is, that pathological
investigations of the nervous system, numerous as they have been, have
effected scarcely anything; the reason evidently being, that the
preliminary knowledge of the normal state is not sufficiently advanced.

increasing the power of the Catholic clergy, see M. Ranke's important
work on the <i>History of the Popes</i>; and as to the result in France, see
<i>Monteil</i>, <i>Hist. des divers Etats</i>, vol. v. pp. 233&ndash;235. Corero, who
was ambassador in France in 1569, writes, &lsquo;Il papa può dire a mio
giudizio, d'aver in questi romori piuttosto guadagnato che perduto,
perciochè tanta era la licenza del vivere, secondo che ho inteso, prima
che quel regno si dividesse in due parti, era tanta poca la devozione
che avevano in Roma e in quei che vi abitavano, che il papa era più
considerato come principe grande in Italia, che come capo della chiesa e
pastore universale. Ma scoperti che si furono gli ugonotti, cominciarono
i cattolici a riverire il suo nome, e riconoscerlo per vero vicario di
Cristo, confirmandosi tanto più in opinione di doverlo tener per tale,
quanto più lo sentivano sprezzare e negare da essi ugonotti.&rsquo; <i>Relations
des Ambassadeurs Vénitiens</i>, vol. ii. p. 162. This interesting passage
is one of many proofs that the immediate advantages derived from the
Reformation have been overrated; though the remote advantages were
undoubtedly immense.</p></div>

and the facility with which they changed their religion, caused many
foreigners to censure their fickleness. See, for instance, <i>Essais de
Montaigne</i>, livre ii. chap. xii. p. 365. Perlin, who travelled in
England in the middle of the sixteenth century, says, &lsquo;The people are
reprobates, and thorough enemies to good manners and letters; for they
don't know whether they belong to God or the devil, which St. Paul has
reprehended in many people, saying, Be not transported with divers sorts
of winds, but be constant and steady to your belief.&rsquo; <i>Antiquarian
Repertory</i>, vol. iv. p. 511, 4to, 1809. See also the remarks of Michele
in 1557, and of Crespet in 1590; <i>Ellis's Original Letters</i>, 2nd series,

the theological feelings of the English crusaders, and the complete
subordination of the political ones: &lsquo;Indignum quippe judicabant
animarum suarum salutem omittere, et obsequium c&oelig;lestis Regis,
clientelæ regis alicujus terreni postponere; constituerunt igitur
terminum, videlicet festum nativitatis beati Johannis Baptistæ.&rsquo;
<i>Matthæi Paris Historia Major</i>, p. 671. It is said, that the first tax
ever imposed in England on personal property was in 1166, and was for
the purpose of crusading. <i>Sinclair's Hist. of the Revenue</i>, vol. i. p.
88: &lsquo;It would not probably have been easily submitted to, had it not
been appropriated for so popular a purpose.&rsquo;</p></div>

being expensive, were soon given up; and his only protection consisted
of &lsquo;the yeomen of the guard, fifty in number, and the common servants of
the king's household.&rsquo; <i>Hallam's Const. Hist.</i> vol. i. p. 46. These
&lsquo;yeomen of the guard were raised by Henry VII. in 1485.&rsquo; <i>Grose's

the anti-ecclesiastical spirit was far too strong to allow her to

firm grasp to the possession of church-lands.&rsquo; <i>Hallam's Const. Hist.</i>

noticed in <i>Felice's History of the Protestants of France</i>, pp. 138&ndash;143,

laws (vol. iii. p. 34), are so unconnected with other parts of his work,
as to have no appearance of belonging to a general scheme. The
commentators, who find a hidden meaning in every author they annotate,
have represented Rabelais as aiming at the highest objects, and seeking
to effect the most extensive social and religious reforms. This I
greatly doubt, at all events I have seen no proof of it; and I cannot
help thinking that Rabelais owes a large share of his reputation to the
obscurity of his language. On the other side of the question, and in
favour of his comprehensiveness, see a bold passage in <i>Coleridge's Lit.

his scepticism &lsquo;is not displayed in religion.&rsquo; But if we use the word
&lsquo;religion&rsquo; in its ordinary sense, as connected with dogma, it is
evident, from Montaigne's language, that he was a sceptic, and an
unflinching one too. Indeed, he goes so far as to say that all religious
opinions are the result of custom: &lsquo;Comme de vray nous n'avons aultre
mire de la vérité et de la raison, que l'exemple et idée des opinions et
usances du païs où nous sommes: <i>là est tousiours la parfaicte
religion</i>, la parfaicte police, parfaict et accomply usage de toutes
choses.&rsquo; <i>Essais de Montaigne</i>, p. 121, livre i. chap. xxx. As a natural
consequence, he lays down that religious error is not criminal, p. 53;
compare p. 28. See also how he notices the usurpations of the
theological spirit, pp. 116, 508, 528. The fact seems to be, that
Montaigne, while recognizing abstractedly the existence of religious
truths, doubted our capacity for knowing them; that is to say, he
doubted if, out of the immense number of religious opinions, there were
any means of ascertaining which were accurate. His observations on
miracles (pp. 541, 653, 654, 675) illustrate the character of his mind;
and what he says on prophetic visions is quoted and confirmed by Pinel,
in his profound work <i>Aliénation Mentale</i>, p. 256. Compare <i>Maury</i>,

ground, that religious opinions, being governed by undeviating laws, owe
their variations to variations in their antecedents, and are always, if
left to themselves, suited to the existing state of things: &lsquo;Et de ces

modern language of the doctrine of religious development; a doctrine
which, since Charron, has been steadily advancing, particularly among
men whose knowledge is extensive enough to enable them to compare the
different religions which have prevailed at different times. In this, as
in other subjects, they who are unable to compare, suppose that
everything is isolated, simply because to them the continuity is
invisible. As to the Alexandrian doctrine of development, found
particularly in Clement and Origen, see <i>Neander's Hist. of the Church</i>,
vol. ii. pp. 234&ndash;257; and in particular pp. 241, 246.</p></div>

Europe</i>, vol. i. pp. 101&ndash;104, and in many other books, is that Richelieu
did destroy their influence; but this error arises from confusing
political influence with social influence. What is termed the political
power of a class, is merely the symptom and manifestation of its real
power; and it is no use to attack the first, unless you can also weaken
the second. The real power of the nobles was social, and that neither
Richelieu nor Louis XIV. could impair; and it remained intact until the
middle of the eighteenth century, when the intellect of France rebelled
against it, overthrew it, and finally effected the French Revolution.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_74_74" id="Footnote_74_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74_74"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> Richelieu appears to have formed the design of humbling
the nobles, at least as early as 1624. See a characteristic passage in
his <i>Mémoires</i>, vol. ii. p. 340. In <i>Swinburne's Courts of Europe</i>, vol.
ii. pp. 63&ndash;65, there is a curious traditional anecdote, which, though
probably false, shows, at all events, the fear and hatred with which the
French nobles regarded the memory of Richelieu more than a century after
his death.</p></div>

whose mind is always ready with historical analogies. <i>Grote's Hist. of

strong natural affection for monks; but the most singular instance I
have found of this sort of love is mentioned by no less a man than De
Thou, respecting Henry III. De Thou (<i>Hist. Univ.</i> vol. x. pp. 666, 667)
says of that prince: &lsquo;Soit tempérament, soit éducation, la présence d'un
moine faisait toujours plaisir à Henri; et je lui ai moi-même souvent
entendu dire, que leur vue produisoit le même effet sur son âme, que le

frequent occasion to quote Le Vassor, I may observe, that he is far more
accurate than is generally supposed, and that he has been very unfairly
treated by the majority of French writers, among whom he is unpopular,
on account of his constant attacks on Louis XIV. Sismondi (<i>Hist. des

même, qu'ils doivent être pris les premiers pour le salut de l'état; car
il n'y a rien de plus agréable au Père commun des hommes, que de
garantir une nation de sa ruine. Dieu n'ayant besoin de rien, lui
consacrer des biens, c'est les destiner à des usages qui lui soient
agréables. De plus, les biens de l'église, de l'aveu du clergé lui-même,
sont en grande partie destinés aux pauvres. Quand l'état est dans le

of the ecclesiastical party respecting this treaty. He says, that the
Bishop of Beauvais, who, the year after the death of Richelieu, was for
a moment at the head of affairs, began his administration by giving to
the Dutch their choice, either to abandon their religion, or else
forfeit their alliance with France: &lsquo;Et il demanda dès le premier jour
aux Hollandois qu'ils se convertissent à la religion catholique, s'ils
vouloient demeurer dans l'alliance de France.&rsquo; <i>Mém. du Cardinal de
Retz</i>, vol. i. p. 39. This, I suppose, is the original authority for the
statement in the <i>Biog. Univ.</i> vol. xiv. p. 440; though, as is too often

Grotius with that of Vattel. These two eminent men are still respected
as the most authoritative expounders of international law; but there is
this important difference between them, that Vattel wrote more than a
century after Grotius, and when the secular principles enforced by
Richelieu had penetrated the minds even of common politicians.
Therefore, Vattel says (<i>Le Droit des Gens</i>, vol. i. pp. 379, 380): &lsquo;On
demande s'il est permis de faire alliance avec une nation qui ne
professe pas la même religion? Si les traités faits avec les ennemis de
la foi sont valides? Grotius a traité la question assez au long. Cette
discussion pouvait être nécessaire dans un temps où la fureur des partis
obscurcissait encore des principes qu'elle avait long-temps fait
oublier, osons croire qu'elle serait superflue dans notre siècle. La loi
naturelle seule régit les traités des nations; la différence de religion
y est absolument étrangère.&rsquo; See also p. 318, and vol. ii. p. 151. On
the other hand, Grotius opposes alliances between nations of different
religion, and says, that nothing can justify them except &lsquo;une extrême
nécessité&hellip;. Car il faut chercher premièrement le règne céleste, c'est
à dire penser avant toutes choses à la propagation de l'évangile.&rsquo; And
he further recommends that princes should follow the advice given on
this subject by Foulques, Archbishop of Rheims! <i>Grotius</i>, <i>le Droit de
la Guerre et de la Paix</i>, livre ii. chap xv. sec. xi. vol. i. pp. 485,
486, edit. Barbeyrac, Amsterdam, 1724, 4to; a passage the more
instructive, because Grotius was a man of great genius and great
humanity. On religious wars, as naturally recognized in barbarous times,
see the curious and important work, <i>Institutes of Timour</i>, pp. 141,

account has been, and still is, very pliant in regard to morals, and
very inflexible in regard to dogmas; a striking proof of the great
sagacity with which her affairs are administered. In <i>Blanco White's
Evidence against Catholicism</i>, p. 48, and in <i>Parr's Works</i>, vol. vii.
pp. 454, 455, there is an unfavourable and, indeed, an unjust notice of
this peculiarity, which, though strongly marked in the Romish church, is
by no means confined to it, but is found in every religious sect which
is regularly organized. Locke, in his <i>Letters on Toleration</i>, observes,
that the clergy are naturally more eager against error than against vice
(<i>Works</i>, vol. v. pp. 6, 7, 241); and their preference of dogmas to
moral truths is also mentioned by M. C. Comte, <i>Traité de Législat.</i>

shrewd remarks made by Le Blanc in his <i>Lettres d'un François</i>, vol. i.
pp. 267, 268; which may be compared with <i>Lord Holland's Mem. of the

complete emancipation of the Catholics, &lsquo;eligibility to worldly honours
and profits would somewhat abate the fever of religious zeal.&rsquo; On this,
there are observations worth attending to in <i>Lord Cloncurry's

sacremens aux malades; l'enterrement des morts avec les cérémonies
accoutumées; &hellip; que les Réformez s'étoient emparez des cloches en
quelques lieux, et en d'autres se serroient de celles des Catholiques
pour avertir de l'heure du prêche; qu'ils affectoient de faire du bruit

32) says, &lsquo;cet instrument, c'est Descartes qui l'a créé; c'est
l'application de l'algèbre à la géométrie.&rsquo; And this, in the highest
sense, is strictly true; for although Vieta and two or three others in
the sixteenth century had anticipated this step, we owe entirely to
Descartes the magnificent discovery of the possibility of applying
algebra to the geometry of curves, he being undoubtedly the first who
expressed them by algebraic equations. See <i>Montucla</i>, <i>Hist. des
Mathémat.</i> vol. i. pp. 704, 705, vol. ii. p. 120, vol. iii. p. 64.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_202_202" id="Footnote_202_202"></a><a href="#FNanchor_202_202"><span class="label">[202]</span></a> The statements of Huygens and of Isaac Vossius to the
effect that Descartes had seen the papers of Snell before publishing his
discovery, are unsupported by any direct evidence; at least none of the
historians of science, so far as I am aware, have brought forward any.
So strong, however, is the disposition of mankind at large to depreciate
great men, and so general is the desire to convict them of plagiarism,
that this charge, improbable in itself, and only resting on the
testimony of two envious rivals, has been not only revived by modern
writers, but has been, even in our own time, spoken of as a
well-established and notorious fact! The flimsy basis of this accusation
is clearly exposed by M. Bordas Demoulin, in his valuable work <i>Le
Cartesianisme</i>, Paris, 1843, vol. ii. pp. 9&ndash;12; while, on the other side
of the question, I refer with regret to <i>Sir D. Brewster on the Progress
of Optics, Second Report of British Association</i>, pp. 309, 310; and to
<i>Whewell's Hist. of the Inductive Sciences</i>, vol. ii. pp. 379, 502,
503.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_203_203" id="Footnote_203_203"></a><a href="#FNanchor_203_203"><span class="label">[203]</span></a> See the interesting remarks of Sprengel (<i>Hist. de la
Médecine</i>, vol. iv. pp. 271, 272), and <i>&#338;uvres de Descartes</i>, vol.
iv. pp. 371 seq. What makes this the more observable is this: that the
study of the crystalline lens was neglected long after the death of
Descartes, and no attempt made for more than a hundred years to complete
his views by ascertaining its intimate structure. Indeed, it is said
(<i>Thomson's Animal Chemistry</i>, p. 512) that the crystalline lens and the
two humours were first analyzed in 1802. Compare <i>Simon's Animal
Chemistry</i>, vol. ii. pp. 419&ndash;421; <i>Henle</i>, <i>Traité d'Anatomie</i>, vol.
i. p. 357; <i>Lepelletier</i>, <i>Physiologie Médicale</i>, vol. iii. p. 160;
<i>Mayo's Human Physiol.</i>, p. 279; <i>Blainville</i>, <i>Physiol. comparée</i>, vol.
iii. pp. 325&ndash;328; none of whom refer to any analysis earlier than the
nineteenth century. I notice this partly as a contribution to the
history of our knowledge, and partly as proving how slow men have been
in following Descartes, and in completing his views; for, as M.
Blanville justly observes, the chemical laws of the lens must be
understood, before we can exhaustively generalize the optical laws of
its refraction; so that, in fact, the researches of Berzelius on the eye
are complemental to those of Descartes. The theory of the limitation of
the crystalline lens according to the descending scale of the animal
kingdom, and the connexion between its development and a general
increase of sensuous perception, seem to have been little studied; but
Dr. Grant (<i>Comparative Anatomy</i>, p. 252) thinks that the lens exists in
some of the rotifera; while in regard to its origin, I find a curious
statement in <i>Müller's Physiology</i>, vol. i. p. 450, that after its
removal in mammals, it has been reproduced by its matrix, the capsule.
(If this can be relied on, it will tell against the suggestion of
Schwann, who supposes, in his <i>Microscopical Researches</i>, 1847, pp. 87,
88, that its mode of life is vegetable, and that it is not &lsquo;a secretion
of its capsule&rsquo;). As to its probable existence in the hydrozoa, see
<i>Rymer Jones's Animal Kingdom</i>, 1855, p. 96, &lsquo;regarded either as a
crystalline lens, or an otolithe;&rsquo; and as to its embryonic development,
see <i>Burdach</i>, <i>Traité de Physiologie</i>, vol. iii. pp. 435&ndash;438.</p></div>

countrymen; but that abroad it had to encounter considerable
opposition.&rsquo; For this no authority is quoted; and yet one would be glad
to know who told Dr. Whewell that the discovery was readily accepted. So
far from meeting in England with ready acceptance, it was during many
years most universally denied. Aubrey was assured by Harvey that, in
consequence of his book on the Circulation of the Blood, he lost much of
his practice, was believed to be crackbrained, and was opposed by &lsquo;all
the physicians.&rsquo; <i>Aubrey's Letters and Lives</i>, vol. ii. p. 383. Dr.
Willis (<i>Life of Harvey</i>, p. xli., in <i>Harvey's Works</i>, edit. Sydenham

universally.&rsquo; Dr. Elliotson (<i>Human Physiology</i>, p. 194) says, &lsquo;His
immediate reward was general ridicule and abuse, and a great diminution
of his practice.&rsquo; Broussais (<i>Examen des Doctrines Médicales</i>, vol. i.
p. vii.) says, &lsquo;Harvey passa pour fou quand il annonça la découverte de
la circulation.&rsquo; Finally, Sir William Temple, who belongs to the
generation subsequent to Harvey, and who, indeed, was not born until
some years after the discovery was made, mentions it in his works in
such a manner as to show that even then it was not universally received
by educated men. See two curious passages, which have escaped the notice

not denied. There is no instance to be found in his works of a denial of
the existence of the external world; nor does the passage quoted from
him by Mr. Jobert (<i>New System of Philos.</i> vol. ii. pp. 161, 162, Lond.
1849) at all justify the interpretation of that ingenious writer, who
confuses certainty in the ordinary sense of the word with certainty in
the Cartesian sense. A similar error is made by those who suppose that
his &lsquo;Je pense, donc je suis,&rsquo; is an enthymeme; and having taken this for
granted, they turn on the great philosopher, and accuse him of begging
the question! Such critics overlook the difference between a logical
process and a psychological one; and therefore they do not see that this
famous sentence was the description of a mental fact, and not the
statement of a mutilated syllogism. The student of the philosophy of
Descartes must always distinguish between these two processes, and
remember that each process has an order of proof peculiar to itself; or
at all events he must remember that such was the opinion of Descartes.

final causes in the inorganic sciences, but must recognize them in the
organic ones; which, in other words, simply means, that we know less of
the organic world than of the inorganic, and that because we know less,
we are to believe more; for here, as everywhere else, the smaller the
science the greater the superstition. <i>Whewell's Philos. of the
Inductive Sciences</i>, 8vo., 1847, vol. i. pp. 620, 627, 628; and his <i>Hist.
of the Induc. Sciences</i>, vol. iii. pp. 430, 431. If the question were to
be decided by authority, it would be enough to appeal to Bacon and
Descartes, the two greatest writers on the philosophy of method in the
seventeenth century; and to Auguste Comte, who is admitted by the few
persons who have mastered his <i>Philosophie Positive</i>, to be the greatest
in our own time. These profound and comprehensive thinkers have all
rejected the study of final causes, which, as they have clearly seen, is
a theological invasion of scientific rights. On the injury which this
study has wrought, and on the check it has given to the advance of our
knowledge, see <i>Robin et Verdeil</i>, <i>Chimie Anat.</i> Paris, 1853, vol. i.

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">HISTORY OF THE PROTECTIVE SPIRIT, AND COMPARISON OF IT IN
FRANCE AND ENGLAND.</div>

<p>When, towards the end of the fifth century, the Roman
empire was broken up, there followed, as is well known,
a long period of ignorance and of crime, in which even
the ablest minds were immersed in the grossest superstitions.
During these, which are rightly called the
Dark Ages, the clergy were supreme: they ruled the
consciences of the most despotic sovereigns, and they
were respected as men of vast learning, because they
alone were able to read and write; because they were
the sole depositaries of those idle conceits of which
European science then consisted; and because they
preserved the legends of the saints and the lives of the
fathers, from which, as it was believed, the teachings of
divine wisdom might easily be gathered.</p>

<p>Such was the degradation of the European intellect
for about five hundred years, during which the credulity
of men reached a height unparalleled in the annals of
ignorance. But at length the human reason, that divine
spark which even the most corrupt society is unable to
extinguish, began to display its power, and disperse the
mists by which it was surrounded. Various circumstances,
which it would be tedious here to discuss,
caused this dispersion to take place at different times in
different countries. However, speaking generally, we
may say that it occurred in the tenth and eleventh centuries,
and that by the twelfth century there was no
nation now called civilized, upon whom the light had
not begun to dawn.</p>

<p>It is from this point that the first great divergence
between the European nations took its rise. Before this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
time their superstition was so great and universal, that
it would avail little to measure the degree of their relative
darkness. Indeed, so low had they fallen, that,
during the earlier period, the authority of the clergy
was in many respects an advantage, as forming a barrier
between the people and their rulers, and as supplying
the sole instance of a class that even made an approach
to intellectual pursuits. But when the great
movement took place, when the human reason began to
rebel, the position of the clergy was suddenly changed.
They had been friendly to reasoning as long as the reasoning
was on their side.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> While they were the only
guardians of knowledge, they were eager to promote its
interests. Now, however, it was falling from their
hands: it was becoming possessed by laymen: it was
growing dangerous: it must be reduced to its proper
dimensions. Then it was that there first became general
the inquisitions, the imprisonments, the torturings, the
burnings, and all the other contrivances by which the
church vainly endeavoured to stem the tide that had
turned against her.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> From that moment there has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
an unceasing struggle between these two great parties,&mdash;the
advocates of inquiry, and the advocates of belief:
a struggle which, however it may be disguised, and
under whatever forms it may appear, is at bottom
always the same, and represents the opposite interests
of reason and faith, of scepticism and credulity, of progress
and reaction, of those who hope for the future,
and of those who cling to the past.</p>

<p>This, then, is the great starting point of modern civilization.
From the moment that reason began, however
faintly, to assert its supremacy, the improvement
of every people has depended upon their obedience to
its dictates, and upon the success with which they have
reduced to its standard the whole of their actions. To
understand, therefore, the original divergence of France
and England, we must seek it in the circumstances
that took place when this, which may be called the
great rebellion of the intellect, was first clearly seen.</p>

<p>If now, with a view to such inquiry, we examine the
history of Europe, we shall find that just at this period
there sprung up the feudal system: a vast scheme of
polity, which, clumsy and imperfect as it was, supplied
many of the wants of the rude people among whom it
arose.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> The connexion between it and the decline of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the ecclesiastical spirit is very obvious. For the feudal
system was the first great secular plan that had been
seen in Europe since the formation of the civil law: it
was the first comprehensive attempt which had been
made, during more than four hundred years, to organize
society according to temporal, not according to spiritual
circumstances, the basis of the whole arrangement being
merely the possession of land, and the performance of
certain military and pecuniary services.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>This was, no doubt, a great step in European civilization,
because it set the first example of a large public
polity in which the spiritual classes as such had no recognized
place;<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> and hence there followed that struggle
between feudality and the church, which has been observed
by several writers, but the origin of which has
been strangely overlooked. What, however, we have
now to notice is, that by the establishment of the feudal
system, the spirit of protection, far from being destroyed,
was probably not even weakened, but only assumed a
new form. Instead of being spiritual, it became temporal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Instead of men looking up to the church, they
looked up to the nobles. For, as a necessary consequence
of this vast movement, or rather as a part of it,
the great possessors of land were now being organized
into an hereditary aristocracy.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> In the tenth century,
we find the first surnames:<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> by the eleventh century
most of the great offices had become hereditary in the
leading families:<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> and in the twelfth century armorial
bearings were invented, as well as other heraldic devices,
which long nourished the conceit of the nobles, and
were valued by their descendants as marks of that superiority
of birth to which, during many ages, all other
superiority was considered subordinate.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>Such was the beginning of the European aristocracy,
in the sense in which that word is commonly used.
With the consolidation of its power, feudality was made,
in reference to the organization of society, the successor
of the church;<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and the nobles, becoming hereditary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
gradually displaced in government, and in the general
functions of authority, the clergy, among whom the
opposite principle of celibacy was now firmly established.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
It is, therefore, evident, that an inquiry into
the origin of the modern protective spirit does, in a
great measure, resolve itself into an inquiry into the
origin of the aristocratic power; since that power was
the exponent, and, as it were, the cover under which the
spirit displayed itself. This, as we shall hereafter see,
is likewise connected with the great religious rebellion
of the sixteenth century; the success of which mainly
depended on the weakness of the protective principle
that opposed it. But, reserving this for future consideration,
I will now endeavour to trace a few of the
circumstances which gave the aristocracy more power
in France than in England, and thus accustomed the
French to a closer and more constant obedience, and
infused into them a more reverential spirit than that
which was usual in our country.</p>

<p>Soon after the middle of the eleventh century, and
therefore while the aristocracy was in the process of formation,
England was conquered by the Duke of Normandy,
who naturally introduced the polity existing in his own
country.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> But, in his hands, it underwent a modification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
suitable to the new circumstances in which he was
placed. He, being in a foreign country, the general of
a successful army composed partly of mercenaries,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> was
able to dispense with some of those feudal usages which
were customary in France. The great Norman lords,
thrown as strangers into the midst of a hostile population,
were glad to accept estates from the crown on
almost any terms that would guarantee their own security.
Of this, William naturally availed himself. For,
by granting baronies on conditions favourable to the
crown, he prevented the barons<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> from possessing that
power which they exercised in France, and which, but
for this, they would have exercised in England. The
result was, that the most powerful of our nobles became
amenable to the law, or, at all events, to the authority
of the king.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Indeed, to such an extent was this carried,
that William, shortly before his death, obliged all
the landowners to render their fealty to him; thus entirely
neglecting that peculiarity of feudalism, according
to which each vassal was separately dependent on his
own lord.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>But in France, the course of affairs was very different.
In that country the great nobles held their lands, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
so much by grant, as by prescription.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> A character of
antiquity was thus thrown over their rights; which,
when added to the weakness of the crown, enabled
them to exercise on their own estates, all the functions
of independent sovereigns.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Even when they received
their first great check, under Philip Augustus,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> they,
in his reign, and indeed long after, wielded a power
quite unknown in England. Thus, to give only two
instances: the right of coining money, which has always
been regarded as an attribute of sovereignty, was never
allowed in England, even to the greatest nobles.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> But
in France it was exercised by many persons independently
of the crown, and was not abrogated until the
sixteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> A similar remark holds good of
what was called the right of private war; by virtue of
which the nobles were allowed to attack each other, and
disturb the peace of the country with the prosecution
of their private feuds. In England the aristocracy were
never strong enough to have this admitted as a right,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
though they too often exercised it as a practice. But in
France it became a part of the established law; it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
incorporated into the text-books of feudalism, and it is
distinctly recognized by Louis IX. and Philip the Fair,&mdash;two
kings of considerable energy, who did every thing
in their power to curtail the enormous authority of the
nobles.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>Out of this difference between the aristocratic power
of France and England, there followed many consequences
of great importance. In our country the nobles,
being too feeble to contend with the crown, were compelled,
in self-defence, to ally themselves with the people.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
About a hundred years after the Conquest, the
Normans and Saxons amalgamated; and both parties
united against the king in order to uphold their common
rights.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The Magna Charta, which John was forced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
yield contained concessions to the aristocracy; but its
most important stipulations were those in favour of &lsquo;all
classes of freemen.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Within half a century, fresh contests
broke out; the barons were again associated with
the people, and again there followed the same results,&mdash;the
extension of popular privileges being each time
the condition and the consequence of this singular
alliance. In the same way, when the Earl of Leicester
raised a rebellion against Henry III., he found his own
party too weak to make head against the crown. He,
therefore, applied to the people:<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> and it is to him that
our House of Commons owes its origin; since he, in
1264, set the first example of issuing writs to cities and
boroughs; thus calling upon citizens and burgesses to
take their place in what had hitherto been a parliament
composed entirely of priests and nobles.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The English aristocracy being thus forced, by their
own weakness, to rely on the people,<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> it naturally followed,
that the people imbibed that tone of independence,
and that lofty bearing, of which our civil and
political institutions are the consequence, rather than
the cause. It is to this, and not to any fanciful peculiarity
of race, that we owe the sturdy and enterprising
spirit for which the inhabitants of this island have long
been remarkable. It is this which has enabled us to
baffle all the arts of oppression, and to maintain for
centuries liberties which no other nation has ever
possessed. And it is this which has fostered and upheld
those great municipal privileges, which, whatever
be their faults, have, at least, the invaluable merit of
accustoming free men to the exercise of power, giving
to citizens the management of their own city, and perpetuating
the idea of independence, by preserving it
in a living type, and by enlisting in its support the interests
and affections of individual men.</p>

<p>But the habits of self-government which, under these
circumstances, were cultivated in England, were, under
opposite circumstances, neglected in France. The great
French lords being too powerful to need the people,
were unwilling to seek their alliance.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> The result
was, that, amid a great variety of forms and names,
society was, in reality, only divided into two classes&mdash;the
upper and the lower, the protectors and the protected.
And, looking at the ferocity of the prevailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
manners, it is not too much to say, that in France,
under the feudal system, every man was either a tyrant
or a slave. Indeed, in most instances, the two characters
were combined in the same person. For, the
practice of subinfeudation, which in our country was
actively checked, became in France almost universal.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
By this, the great lords having granted lands on condition
of fealty and other services to certain persons,
these last subgranted them; that is, made them over
on similar conditions to other persons, who had likewise
the power of bestowing them on a fourth party,
and so on in an endless series;<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> thus forming a long
chain of dependence, and, as it were, organizing submission
into a system.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> In England, on the other
hand, such arrangements were so unsuited to the
general state of affairs, that it is doubtful if they were
ever carried on to any extent; and, at all events, it
is certain that, in the reign of Edward I., they were
finally stopped by the statute known to lawyers as
<i>Quia emptores</i>.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>Thus early was there a great social divergence between
France and England. The consequences of this
were still more obvious when, in the fourteenth century,
the feudal system rapidly decayed in both countries.
For in England, the principle of protection
being feeble, men were in some degree accustomed to
self-government; and they were able to hold fast by
those great institutions which would have been ill
adapted to the more obedient habits of the French
people. Our municipal privileges, the rights of our
yeomanry, and the security of our copyholders, were,
from the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
three most important guarantees for the liberties of
England.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> In France such guarantees were impossible.
The real division being between those who were noble,
and those who were not noble, no room was left for
the establishment of intervening classes; but all were
compelled to fall into one of these two great ranks.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
The French have never had any thing answering to our
yeomanry; nor were copyholders recognized by their
laws. And, although they attempted to introduce into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
their country municipal institutions, all such efforts
were futile; for, while they copied the forms of liberty,
they lacked that bold and sturdy spirit by which alone
liberty can be secured. They had, indeed, its image
and superscription; but they wanted the sacred fire
that warms the image into life. Every thing else they
possessed. The show and appliances of freedom were
there. Charters were granted to their towns, and privileges
conceded to their magistrates. All, however,
was useless. For it is not by the wax and parchment
of lawyers that the independence of men can be preserved.
Such things are the mere externals; they set
off liberty to advantage; they are as its dress and paraphernalia,
its holiday-suit in times of peace and quiet.
But, when the evil days set in, when the invasions of
despotism have begun, liberty will be retained, not by
those who can show the oldest deeds and the largest
charters, but by those who have been most inured to
habits of independence, most accustomed to think and
act for themselves, and most regardless of that insidious
protection which the upper classes have always been so
ready to bestow, that, in many countries, they have now
left nothing worth the trouble to protect.</p>

<p>And so it was in France. The towns, with few exceptions,
fell at the first shock; and the citizens lost
those municipal privileges which, not being grafted
on the national character, it was found impossible to
preserve. In the same way, in our country, power naturally,
and by the mere force of the democratic movement,
fell into the hands of the House of Commons;
whose authority has ever since, notwithstanding occasional
checks, continued to increase at the expense
of the more aristocratic parts of the legislature. The
only institution answering to this in France was the
States-General; which, however, had so little influence,
that, in the opinion of native historians, it
was hardly to be called an institution at all.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the French were, by this time, so accustomed to the
idea of protection, and to the subordination which that
idea involves, that they were little inclined to uphold
an establishment which, in their constitution, was the
sole representative of the popular element. The result
was, that, by the fourteenth century, the liberties of
Englishmen were secured;<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> and, since then, their only
concern has been to increase what they have already
obtained. But in that same century, in France, the
protective spirit assumed a new form; the power of the
aristocracy was, in a great measure, succeeded by the
power of the crown; and there began that tendency to
centralization which, having been pushed still further,
first under Louis XIV., and afterwards under Napoleon,
has become the bane of the French people.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> For by it
the feudal ideas of superiority and submission have long
survived that barbarous age to which alone they were
suited. Indeed, by their transmigration, they seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
to have gained fresh strength. In France, every thing
is referred to one common centre, in which all civil
functions are absorbed. All improvements of any importance,
all schemes for bettering even the material condition
of the people must receive the sanction of government;
the local authorities not being considered equal
to such arduous tasks. In order that inferior magistrates
may not abuse their power, no power is conferred upon
them. The exercise of independent jurisdiction is
almost unknown. Every thing that is done must be
done at head quarters.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> The government is believed
to see every thing, know every thing, and provide for
every thing. To enforce this monstrous monopoly there
has been contrived a machinery well worthy of the
design. The entire country is covered by an immense
array of officials;<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> who, in the regularity of their hierarchy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and in the order of their descending series, form
an admirable emblem of that feudal principle, which
ceasing to be territorial, has now become personal. In
fact, the whole business of the state is conducted on
the supposition that no man either knows his own interest,
or is fit to take care of himself. So paternal are
the feelings of government, so eager for the welfare of
its subjects, that it has drawn within its jurisdiction the
most rare, as well as the most ordinary, actions of life.
In order that the French may not make imprudent
wills, it has limited the right of bequest; and, for fear
that they should bequeath their property wrongly, it
prevents them from bequeathing the greater part of it
at all. In order that society may be protected by its
police, it has directed that no one shall travel without
a passport. And when men are actually travelling, they
are met at every turn by the same interfering spirit,
which, under pretence of protecting their persons,
shackles their liberty. Into another matter, far more
serious, the French have carried the same principle.
Such is their anxiety to protect society against criminals,
that, when an offender is placed at the bar of one of
their courts, there is exhibited a spectacle which is no
idle boast to say we, in England, could not tolerate for
a single hour. There is seen a great public magistrate,
by whom the prisoner is about to be tried, examining
him in order to ascertain his supposed guilt, re-examining
him, cross-examining him, performing the duties,
not of a judge, but of a prosecutor, and bringing to bear
against the unhappy man all the authority of his judicial
position, all his professional subtlety, all his experience,
all the dexterity of his practised understanding. This
is, perhaps, the most alarming of the many instances
in which the tendencies of the French intellect are
shown; because it supplies a machinery ready for the
purposes of absolute power; because it brings the administration
of justice into disrepute, by associating with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
it an idea of unfairness; and because it injures that
calm and equable temper, which it is impossible fully to
maintain under a system that makes a magistrate an
advocate, and turns the judge into a partizan. But this,
mischievous as it is, only forms part of a far larger
scheme. For, to the method by which criminals are
discovered, there is added an analogous method, by
which crime is prevented. With this view, the people,
even in their ordinary amusements, are watched and
carefully superintended. Lest they should harm each
other by some sudden indiscretion, precautions are
taken similar to those with which a father might surround
his children. In their fairs, at their theatres,
their concerts, and their other places of public resort,
there are always present soldiers, who are sent to see
that no mischief is done, that there is no unnecessary
crowding, that no one uses harsh language, that no one
quarrels with his neighbour. Nor does the vigilance
of the government stop there. Even the education of
children is brought under the control of the state, instead
of being regulated by the judgment of masters
or parents.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> And the whole plan is executed with such
energy, that, as the French while men are never let
alone, just so while children they are never left alone.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
At the same time, it being reasonably supposed that the
adults thus kept in pupilage cannot be proper judges of
their own food, the government has provided for this
also. Its prying eye follows the butcher to the shambles,
and the baker to the oven. By its paternal hand, meat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
is examined lest it should be bad, and bread is weighed
lest it should be light. In short, without multiplying
instances, with which most readers must be familiar,
it is enough to say that in France, as in every country
where the protective principle is active, the government
has established a monopoly of the worst kind; a
monopoly which comes home to the business and
bosoms of men, follows them in their daily avocations,
troubles them with its petty, meddling spirit, and, what
is worse than all, diminishes their responsibility to
themselves; thus depriving them of what is the only
real education that most minds receive,&mdash;the constant
necessity of providing for future contingencies, and the
habit of grappling with the difficulties of life.</p>

<p>The consequence of all this has been, that the French,
though a great and splendid people,&mdash;a people full of
mettle, high-spirited, abounding in knowledge, and
perhaps less oppressed by superstition than any other
in Europe,&mdash;have always been found unfit to exercise
political power. Even when they have possessed it,
they have never been able to combine permanence with
liberty. One of these two elements has always been
wanting. They have had free governments, which have
not been stable. They have had stable governments,
which have not been free. Owing to their fearless
temper, they have rebelled, and no doubt will continue
to rebel, against so evil a condition.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> But it does not
need the tongue of a prophet to tell that, for at least
some generations, all such efforts must be unsuccessful.
For men can never be free, unless they are
educated to freedom. And this is not the education
which is to be found in schools, or gained from books;
but it is that which consists in self-discipline, in self-reliance,
and in self-government. These, in England,
are matters of hereditary descent&mdash;traditional
habits, which we imbibe in our youth, and which regulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
us in the conduct of life. The old associations
of the French all point in another direction. At
the slightest difficulty, they call on the government for
support. What with us is competition, with them is
monopoly. That which we effect by private companies,
they effect by public boards. They cannot cut
a canal, or lay down a railroad, without appealing to
the government for aid. With them, the people look
to the rulers; with us, the rulers look to the people.
With them, the executive is the centre from which
society radiates;<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> with us, society is the instigator,
and the executive the organ. The difference in the
result has corresponded with the difference in the process.
We have been made fit for political power, by
the long exercise of civil rights; they, neglecting the
exercise, think they can at once begin with the power.
We have always shown a determination to uphold our
liberties, and, when the times are fitting, to increase
them; and this we have done with a decency and a
gravity natural to men to whom such subjects have
long been familiar. But the French, always treated
as children, are, in political matters, children still.
And as they have handled the most weighty concerns
in that gay and volatile spirit which adorns
their lighter literature, it is no wonder that they have
failed in matters where the first condition of success
is, that men should have been long accustomed to rely
upon their own energies, and that before they try their
skill in a political struggle, their resources should have
been sharpened by that preliminary discipline, which
a contest with the difficulties of civil life can never fail
to impart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>These are among the considerations by which we
must be guided, in estimating the probable destinies of
the great countries of Europe. But what we are now
rather concerned with is, to notice how the opposite
tendencies of France and England long continued to be
displayed in the condition and treatment of their aristocracy;
and how from this there naturally followed
some striking differences between the war conducted
by the Fronde, and that waged by the Long Parliament.</p>

<p>When, in the fourteenth century, the authority of
the French kings began rapidly to increase, the political
influence of the nobility was, of course, correspondingly
diminished. What, however, proves the
extent to which their power had taken root, is the undoubted
fact, that, notwithstanding this to them unfavourable
circumstance, the people were never able to
emancipate themselves from their control.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> The relation
the nobles bore to the throne became entirely
changed; that which they bore to the people remained
almost the same. In England, slavery, or villenage,
as it is mildly termed, quickly diminished, and was
extinct by the end of the sixteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
France, it lingered on two hundred years later, and
was only destroyed in that great Revolution by which
the possessors of ill-gotten power were called to so
sharp an account.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Thus, too, until the last seventy
years, the nobles were in France exempt from those
onerous taxes which oppressed the people. The taille
and corvée were heavy and grievous exactions, but
they fell solely on men of ignoble birth;<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> for the
French aristocracy, being a high and chivalrous race,
would have deemed it an insult to their illustrious
descent, if they had been taxed to the same amount as
those whom they despised as their inferiors.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
every thing tended to nurture this general contempt.
Every thing was contrived to humble one class, and
exalt the other. For the nobles there were reserved
the best appointments in the church, and also the most
important military posts.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> The privilege of entering the
army as officers was confined to them;<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> and they alone
possessed a prescriptive right to belong to the cavalry.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
At the same time, and to avoid the least chance of confusion,
an equal vigilance was displayed in the most
trifling matters, and care was taken to prevent any
similarity, even in the amusements of the two classes.
To such a pitch was this brought, that, in many parts
of France, the right of having an aviary or a dovecote
depended entirely on a man's rank; and no Frenchman,
whatever his wealth might be, could keep pigeons,
unless he were a noble; it being considered that these
recreations were too elevated for persons of plebeian
origin.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Circumstances like these are valuable, as evidence
of the state of society to which they belong; and
their importance will become peculiarly obvious, when
we compare them with the opposite condition of England.</p>

<p>For in England, neither these nor any similar distinctions
have ever been known. The spirit of which
our yeomanry, copyholders, and free burgesses were
the representatives, proved far too strong for those protective
and monopolizing principles of which the aristocracy
are the guardians in politics, and the clergy in
religion. And it is to the successful opposition made
by these feelings of individual independence that we owe
our two greatest national acts&mdash;our Reformation in the
sixteenth, and our Rebellion in the seventeenth century.
Before, however, tracing the steps taken in these matters,
there is one other point of view to which I wish to call
attention, as a further illustration of the early and radical
difference between France and England.</p>

<p>In the eleventh century there arose the celebrated
institution of chivalry,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> which was to manners what
feudalism was to politics. This connexion is clear, not
only from the testimony of contemporaries, but also
from two general considerations. In the first place,
chivalry was so highly aristocratic, that no one could
even receive knighthood unless he were of noble birth;<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
and the preliminary education which was held to be
necessary was carried on either in schools appointed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the nobles, or else in their own baronial castles.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> In
the second place, it was essentially a protective, and
not at all a reforming institution. It was contrived
with a view to remedy certain oppressions as they successively
arose; opposed in this respect to the reforming
spirit, which, being remedial rather than palliative,
strikes at the root of an evil by humbling the class from
which the evil proceeds, passing over individual cases
in order to direct its attention to general causes. But
chivalry, so far from doing this, was in fact a fusion of
the aristocratic and the ecclesiastical forms of the protective
spirit.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> For, by introducing among the nobles
the principle of knighthood, which, being personal, could
never be bequeathed, it presented a point at which the
ecclesiastical doctrine of celibacy could coalesce with the
aristocratic doctrine of hereditary descent.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Out of this
coalition sprung results of great moment. It is to this
that Europe owes those orders, half aristocratic half religious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
the Knights Templars, the Knights of St. James,
the Knights of St. John, the Knights of St. Michael:
establishments which inflicted the greatest evils on society;
and whose members, combining analogous vices,
enlivened the superstition of monks with the debauchery
of soldiers. As a natural consequence, an immense
number of noble knights were solemnly pledged to
&lsquo;defend the church;&rsquo; an ominous expression, the meaning
of which is too well known to the readers of ecclesiastical
history.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Thus it was that chivalry, uniting
the hostile principles of celibacy and noble birth, became
the incarnation of the spirit of the two classes to which
those principles belonged. Whatever benefit, therefore,
this institution may have conferred upon manners,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
there can be no doubt that it actively contributed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
keep men in a state of pupilage, and stopped the march
of society by prolonging the term of its infancy.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>On this account, it is evident that, whether we look
at the immediate or at the remote tendency of chivalry,
its strength and duration become a measure of the predominance
of the protective spirit. If, with this view,
we compare France and England, we shall find fresh
proof of the early divergence of those countries. Tournaments,
the first open expression of chivalry, are of
French origin.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> The greatest and, indeed, the only
two great describers of chivalry are Joinville and Froissart,
both of whom were Frenchmen. Bayard, that
famous chevalier, who is always considered as the last
representative of chivalry, was a Frenchman, and was
killed when fighting for Francis I. Nor was it until
nearly forty years after his death that tournaments were
finally abolished in France, the last one having been
held in 1560.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>But in England, the protective spirit being much less
active than in France, we should expect to find that
chivalry, as its offspring, had less influence. And such
was really the case. The honours that were paid to
knights, and the social distinctions by which they were
separated from the other classes, were never so great in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
our country as in France.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> As men became more free,
the little respect they had for such matters still further
diminished. In the thirteenth century, and indeed in
the very reign in which burgesses were first returned
to parliament, the leading symbol of chivalry fell into
such disrepute, that a law was passed obliging certain
persons to accept that rank of knighthood which in
other nations was one of the highest objects of ambition.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
In the fourteenth century, this was followed by
another blow, which deprived knighthood of its exclusively
military character; the custom having grown up
in the reign of Edward III. of conferring it on the
judges in the courts of law, thus turning a warlike title
into a civil honour.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Finally, before the end of the
fifteenth century, the spirit of chivalry, in France still
at its height, was in our country extinct, and this mischievous
institution had become a subject for ridicule
even among the people themselves.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> To these circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
we may add two others, which seem worthy of
observation. The first is, that the French, notwithstanding
their many admirable qualities, have always
been more remarkable for personal vanity than the
English;<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> a peculiarity partly referable to those chivalric
traditions which even their occasional republics
have been unable to destroy, and which makes them
attach undue importance to external distinctions, by
which I mean, not only dress and manners, but also
medals, ribbons, stars, crosses, and the like, which we,
a prouder people, have never held in such high estimation.
The other circumstance is, that duelling has
from the beginning been more popular in France than in
England; and as this is a custom which we owe to chivalry,
the difference in this respect between the two countries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
supplies another link in that long chain of evidence
by which we must estimate their national tendencies.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>The old associations, of which these facts are but the
external expression, now continued to act with increasing
vigour. In France, the protective spirit, carried
into religion, was strong enough to resist the Reformation,
and preserve to the clergy the forms, at least, of
their ancient supremacy. In England, the pride of men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and their habits of self-reliance, enabled them to mature
into a system what is called the right of private judgment,
by which some of the most cherished traditions
were eradicated; and this, as we have already seen, being
quickly succeeded, first by scepticism, and then by
toleration, prepared the way for that subordination of
the church to the state, for which we are pre-eminent,
and without a rival, among the nations of Europe.
The very same tendency, acting in politics, displayed
analogous results. Our ancestors found no difficulty
in humbling the nobles, and reducing them to comparative
insignificance. The wars of the Roses, by breaking
up the leading families into two hostile factions,
aided this movement;<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> and, after the reign of Edward
IV., there is no instance of any Englishman, even of
the highest rank, venturing to carry on those private
wars, by which, in other countries, the great lords still
disturbed the peace of society.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> When the civil contests
subsided, the same spirit displayed itself in the
policy of Henry VII. and Henry VIII. For, those
princes, despots as they were, mainly oppressed the
highest classes; and even Henry VIII., notwithstanding
his barbarous cruelties, was loved by the people, to
whom his reign was, on the whole, decidedly beneficial.
Then there came the Reformation; which, being an uprising
of the human mind, was essentially a rebellious
movement, and thus increasing the insubordination of
men, sowed, in the sixteenth century, the seeds of those
great political revolutions which, in the seventeenth century,
broke out in nearly every part of Europe. The connexion
between these two revolutionary epochs is a subject
full of interest; but, for the purpose of the present
chapter, it will be sufficient to notice such events,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
during the latter half of the sixteenth century, as explain
the sympathy between the ecclesiastical and aristocratic
classes, and prove how the same circumstances
that were fatal to the one, also prepared the way for
the downfall of the other.</p>

<p>When Elizabeth ascended the throne of England, a
large majority of the nobility were opposed to the Protestant
religion. This we know from the most decisive
evidence; and, even if we had no such evidence, a general
acquaintance with human nature would induce us
to suspect that such was the case. For, the aristocracy,
by the very conditions of their existence, must, as
a body, always be averse to innovation. And this, not
only because by a change they have much to lose and
little to gain, but because some of their most pleasurable
emotions are connected with the past rather than
with the present. In the collision of actual life, their
vanity is sometimes offended by the assumptions of inferior
men; it is frequently wounded by the successful
competition of able men. These are mortifications to
which, in the progress of society, their liability is constantly
increasing. But the moment they turn to the
past, they see in those good old times which are now
gone by, many sources of consolation. There they find
a period in which their glory is without a rival. When
they look at their pedigrees, their quarterings, their
escutcheons; when they think of the purity of their
blood, and the antiquity of their ancestors&mdash;they experience
a comfort which ought amply to atone for any
present inconvenience. The tendency of this is very
obvious, and has shown itself in the history of every
aristocracy the world has yet seen. Men who have
worked themselves to so extravagant a pitch as to believe
that it is an honour to have had one ancestor who
came over with the Normans, and another ancestor who
was present at the first invasion of Ireland&mdash;men who
have reached this ecstacy of the fancy are not disposed
to stop there, but, by a process with which most minds
are familiar, they generalize their view; and, even on
matters not immediately connected with their fame,
they acquire a habit of associating grandeur with antiquity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and of measuring value by age; thus transferring
to the past an admiration which otherwise they might
reserve for the present.</p>

<p>The connexion between these feelings and those which
animate the clergy is very evident. What the nobles
are to politics, that are the priests to religion. Both
classes, constantly appealing to the voice of antiquity,
rely much on tradition, and make great account of upholding
established customs. Both take for granted
that what is old is better than what is new; and that
in former times there were means of discovering truths
respecting government and theology which we, in these
degenerate ages, no longer possess. And it may be
added, that the similarity of their functions follows from
the similarity of their principles. Both are eminently
protective, stationary, or, as they are sometimes called,
conservative. It is believed that the aristocracy guard
the state against revolution, and that the clergy keep
the church from error. The first are the enemies of
reformers; the others are the scourge of heretics.</p>

<p>It does not enter into the province of this Introduction
to examine how far these principles are reasonable,
or to inquire into the propriety of notions which suppose
that, on certain subjects of immense importance, men
are to remain stationary, while on all other subjects they
are constantly advancing. But what I now rather wish
to point out, is the manner in which, in the reign of
Elizabeth, the two great conservative and protective
classes were weakened by that vast movement, the Reformation,
which, though completed in the sixteenth
century, had been prepared by a long chain of intellectual
antecedents.</p>

<p>Whatever the prejudices of some may suggest, it will
be admitted, by all unbiassed judges, that the Protestant
Reformation was neither more nor less than an
open rebellion. Indeed, the mere mention of private
judgment, on which it was avowedly based, is enough
to substantiate this fact. To establish the right of private
judgment, was to appeal from the church to individuals;
it was to increase the play of each man's intellect;
it was to test the opinions of the priesthood by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the opinions of laymen; it was, in fact, a rising of the
scholars against their teachers, of the ruled against
their rulers. And although the reformed clergy, as
soon as they had organised themselves into a hierarchy,
did undoubtedly abandon the great principle with which
they started, and attempt to impose articles and canons
of their own contrivance, still, this ought not to blind
us to the merits of the Reformation itself. The tyranny
of the Church of England, during the reign of Elizabeth,
and still more during the reigns of her two successors,
was but the natural consequence of that corruption
which power always begets in those who wield it, and
does not lessen the importance of the movement by
which the power was originally obtained. For men
could not forget that, tried by the old theological theory,
the church of England was a schismatic establishment,
and could only defend itself from the charge of heresy
by appealing to that private judgment, to the exercise
of which it owed its existence, but of the rights of which
its own proceedings were a constant infraction. It was
evident that if, in religious matters, private judgment
were supreme, it became a high spiritual crime to issue
any articles, or to take any measure, by which that
judgment could be tied up; while, on the other hand,
if the right of private judgment were not supreme, the
church of England was guilty of apostacy, inasmuch as
its founders did, by virtue of the interpretation which
their own private judgment made of the Bible, abandon
tenets which they had hitherto held, stigmatize those
tenets as idolatrous, and openly renounce their allegiance
to what had for centuries been venerated as the
catholic and apostolic church.</p>

<p>This was a simple alternative; which might, indeed,
be kept out of sight, but could not be refined away, and
most assuredly has never been forgotten. The memory
of the great truth it conveys was preserved by the
writings and teachings of the Puritans, and by those
habits of thought natural to an inquisitive age. And
when the fulness of time had come, it did not fail to
bear its fruit. It continued slowly to fructify; and
before the middle of the seventeenth century, its seed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
had quickened into a life, the energy of which nothing
could withstand. That same right of private judgment
which the early Reformers had loudly proclaimed, was
now pushed to an extent fatal to those who opposed it.
This it was which, carried into politics, overturned the
government, and, carried into religion, upset the
church.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> For, rebellion and heresy are but different
forms of the same disregard of tradition, the same bold
and independent spirit. Both are of the nature of a
protest made by modern ideas against old associations.
They are as a struggle between the feelings of the present
and the memory of the past. Without the exercise
of private judgment, such a contest could never
take place; the mere conception of it could not enter
the minds of men, nor would they even dream of controlling,
by their individual energy, those abuses to
which all great societies are liable. It is, therefore, in
the highest degree natural that the exercise of this
judgment should be opposed by those two powerful
classes who, from their position, their interests, and the
habits of their mind, are more prone than any other to
cherish antiquity, cleave to superannuated customs, and
uphold institutions which, to use their favourite language,
have been consecrated by the wisdom of their
fathers.</p>

<p>From this point of view we are able to see with great
clearness the intimate connexion which, at the accession
of Elizabeth, existed between the English nobles
and the Catholic clergy. Notwithstanding many exceptions,
an immense majority of both classes opposed
the Reformation, because it was based on that right of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
private judgment of which they, as the protectors of old
opinions, were the natural antagonists. All this can
excite no surprise; it was in the order of things, and
strictly accordant with the spirit of those two great
sections of society. Fortunately, however, for our
country, the throne was now occupied by a sovereign
who was equal to the emergency, and who, instead of
yielding to the two classes, availed herself of the temper
of the age to humble them. The manner in which this
was effected by Elizabeth, in respect, first to the Catholic
clergy, and afterwards to the Protestant clergy,<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
forms one of the most interesting parts of our history;
and in an account of the reign of the great queen, I
hope to examine it at considerable length. At present,
it will be sufficient to glance at her policy towards the
nobles&mdash;that other class with which the priesthood, by
their interests, opinions, and associations, have always
much in common.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, at her accession to the throne, finding that
the ancient families adhered to the ancient religion, naturally
called to her councils advisers who were more
likely to uphold the novelties on which the age was
bent. She selected men who, being little burdened by
past associations, were more inclined to favour present
interests. The two Bacons, the two Cecils, Knollys,
Sadler, Smith, Throgmorton, Walsingham, were the
most eminent statesmen and diplomatists in her reign;
but all of them were commoners; only one did she raise
to the peerage; and they were certainly nowise remarkable,
either for the rank of their immediate connexions,
or for the celebrity of their remote ancestors.
They, however, were recommended to Elizabeth by
their great abilities, and by their determination to uphold
a religion which the ancient aristocracy naturally
opposed. And it is observable that, among the accusations
which the Catholics brought against the queen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
they taunted her, not only with forsaking the old religion,
but also with neglecting the old nobility.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>Nor does it require much acquaintance with the history
of the time to see the justice of this charge. Whatever
explanation we may choose to give of the fact, it
cannot be denied that, during the reign of Elizabeth,
there was an open and constant opposition between the
nobles and the executive government. The rebellion
of 1569 was essentially an aristocratic movement;
it was a rising of the great families of the north
against what they considered the upstart and plebeian
administration of the queen.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> The bitterest enemy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Elizabeth was certainly Mary of Scotland; and the interests
of Mary were publicly defended by the Duke of
Norfolk, the Earl of Northumberland, the Earl of Westmoreland,
and the Earl of Arundel; while there is
reason to believe that her cause was secretly favoured
by the Marquis of Northampton, the Earl of Pembroke,
the Earl of Derby, the Earl of Cumberland, the Earl of
Shrewsbury, and the Earl of Sussex.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>The existence of this antagonism of interests could
not escape the sagacity of the English government.
Cecil, who was the most powerful of the ministers of
Elizabeth, and who was at the head of affairs for forty
years, made it part of his business to study the genealogies
and material resources of the great families; and
this he did, not out of idle curiosity, but in order to increase
his control over them, or, as a great historian
says, to let them know &lsquo;that his eye was upon them.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
The queen herself, though too fond of power, was by no
means of a cruel disposition; but she seemed to delight
in humbling the nobles. On them her hand fell heavily;
and there is hardly to be found a single instance of her
pardoning their offences, while she punished several of
them for acts which would now be considered no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
offences at all. She was always unwilling to admit
them to authority; and it is unquestionably true that,
taking them as a class, they were, during her long and
prosperous reign, treated with unusual disrespect.
Indeed, so clearly marked was her policy, that when
the ducal order became extinct, she refused to renew
it; and a whole generation passed away to whom the
name of duke was a mere matter of history, a point
to be mooted by antiquaries, but with which the business
of practical life had no concern.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Whatever
may be her other faults, she was on this subject always
consistent. Although she evinced the greatest anxiety
to surround the throne with men of ability, she cared
little for those conventional distinctions by which the
minds of ordinary sovereigns are greatly moved. She
made no account of dignity of rank; she did not even
care for purity of blood. She valued men neither for the
splendour of their ancestry, nor for the length of their
pedigrees, nor for the grandeur of their titles. Such
questions she left for her degenerate successors, to the
size of whose understandings they were admirably fitted.
Our great queen regulated her conduct by another standard.
Her large and powerful intellect, cultivated to
its highest point by reflection and study, taught her the
true measure of affairs, and enabled her to see, that to
make a government flourish, its councillors must be men
of ability and of virtue; but that if these two conditions
are fulfilled, the nobles may be left to repose in the enjoyment
of their leisure, unoppressed by those cares of
the state for which, with a few brilliant exceptions, they
are naturally disqualified by the number of their prejudices
and by the frivolity of their pursuits.</p>

<p>After the death of Elizabeth, an attempt was made,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
first by James, and then by Charles, to revive the power
of the two great protective classes, the nobles and the
clergy. But so admirably had the policy of Elizabeth
been supported by the general temper of the age, that
it was found impossible for the Stuarts to execute their
mischievous plans. The exercise of private judgment,
both in religion and in politics, had become so habitual,
that these princes were unable to subjugate it to their
will. And as Charles I., with inconceivable blindness,
and with an obstinacy even greater than that of his
father, persisted in adopting in their worst forms the
superannuated theories of protection, and attempted
to enforce a scheme of government which men from
their increasing independence were determined to reject,
there inevitably arose that memorable collision
which is well termed The Great Rebellion of England.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
The analogy between this and the Protestant Reformation,
I have already noticed; but what we have now
to consider, and what, in the next chapter, I will endeavour
to trace, is the nature of the difference between
our Rebellion, and those contemporary wars of the
Fronde, to which it was in some respects very similar.</p>

avoient si long-temps exercé la subtilité des Grecs fussent seulement
comprises par les Latins.&rsquo; As knowledge advanced, the opposition between
inquiry and belief became more marked: the church redoubled her efforts,
and at the end of the twelfth century the popes first formally called on
the secular power to punish heretics; and the earliest constitution
addressed &lsquo;inquisitoribus hæreticæ pravitatis&rsquo; is one by Alexander IV.

origin of the word may be, it is certain that the thing did not, and
could not, exist before the tenth century at the earliest: inasmuch as
the extreme disorganisation of society rendered so coercive an
institution impossible. M. Guizot, in another work (<i>Essais sur l'Hist.

fourth to the tenth century, the clergy were so eminently a class apart,

and <i>Petrie's Ecclesiast. Archit.</i> p. 382. But under the feudal system
this immunity was lost; and in regard to performing services no
separation of classes was admitted. &lsquo;After the feudal polity became

<i>Brougham's Polit. Philos.</i> vol. i. p. 339, vol. iii. p. 222.</p>

<p>In regard to the general question of the amalgamation of races, we have
three distinct kinds of evidence:</p>

<p>1st. Towards the end of the twelfth century, a new language began to be
formed by blending Norman with Saxon; and English literature, properly
so called, dates from the commencement of the thirteenth century.
Compare <i>Madden's Preface to Layamon</i>, 1847, vol. i. pp. xx. xxi., with
<i>Turner's Hist. of England</i>, vol. viii. pp. 214, 217, 436, 437.</p>

<p>2nd. We have the specific statement of a writer in the reign of Henry
II., that &lsquo;sic permixtæ sunt nationes ut vix discerni possit hodie, de
liberis loquor, quis Anglicus, quis Normannus sit genere.&rsquo; <i>Note in
Hallam's Middle Ages</i>, vol. ii. p. 106.</p>

<p>3rd. Before the thirteenth century had passed away, the difference of
dress, which in that state of society would survive many other
differences, was no longer observed, and the distinctive peculiarities
of Norman and Saxon attire had disappeared. See <i>Strutt's View of the
Dress and Habits of the People of England</i>, vol. ii. p. 67, edit.
Planché, 1842, 4to.</p></div>

system of government in this country.&rsquo; <i>Campbell's Chief-Justices</i>, vol.
i. p. 61. Some writers (see, for instance, <i>Dalrymple's Hist. of Feudal
Property</i>, p. 332) suppose that burgesses were summoned before the reign
of Henry III.: but this assertion is not only unsupported by evidence,
but is in itself improbable; because at an early period the citizens,
though rapidly increasing in power, were hardly important enough to
warrant such a step being taken. The best authorities are now agreed to
refer the origin of the House of Commons to the period mentioned in the
text. See <i>Hallam's Supplement</i>, <i>Notes</i>, pp. 335&ndash;339; <i>Spence's Origin
of the Laws of Europe</i>, p. 512; <i>Campbell's Chancellors</i>, vol. i. p.
155; <i>Lingard's England</i>, vol. ii. p. 138; <i>Guizot's Essais</i>, p. 319.
The notion of tracing this to the wittenagemot is as absurd as finding
the origin of juries in the system of compurgators; both of which were
favourite errors in the seventeenth, and even in the eighteenth century.
In regard to the wittenagemot, this idea still lingers among
antiquaries: but, in regard to compurgators, even they have abandoned
their old ground, and it is now well understood that trial by jury did
not exist till long after the Conquest. Compare <i>Palgrave's English
Commonwealth</i>, part i. pp. 243 seq., with <i>Meyer</i>, <i>Instit. Judic.</i> vol.
ii. pp. 152&ndash;173. There are few things in our history so irrational as
the admiration expressed by a certain class of writers for the
institutions of our barbarous Anglo-Saxon ancestors.</p></div>

class, the English yeomanry, is an interesting subject, and one for
which I have collected considerable materials; at present, I will only
say, that its decline was first distinctly perceptible in the latter
half of the seventeenth century, and was consummated by the
rapidly-increasing power of the commercial and manufacturing classes
early in the eighteenth century. After losing their influence, their
numbers naturally diminished, and they made way for other bodies of men,
whose habits of mind were less prejudiced, and therefore better suited
to that new state which society assumed in the last age. I mention this,
because some writers regret the almost total destruction of the yeoman
freeholders; overlooking the fact, that they are disappearing, not in
consequence of any violent revolution or stretch of arbitrary power, but
simply by the general march of affairs; society doing away with what it
no longer requires. Compare <i>Kay's Social Condition of the People</i>, vol.
i. pp. 43, 602, with a letter from Wordsworth in <i>Bunbury's Correspond.

<p>Mr. Bulwer, writing twenty years ago, says: &lsquo;Not only cannot a commune
determine its own expenses without the consent of the minister or one of
his deputed functionaries, it cannot even erect a building, the cost of
which shall have been sanctioned, without the plan being adopted by a
board of public works attached to the central authority, and having the
supervision and direction of every public building throughout the
Kingdom.&rsquo; <i>Bulwer's Monarchy of the Middle Classes</i>, 1836, vol. ii. p. 262.</p>

<p>M. Tocqueville, writing in the present year (1856), says, &lsquo;Sous l'ancien

petit hameau en France, hôpital, fabrique, couvent ni
collège, qui pût avoir une volonté indépendante dans ses
affaires particulières, ni administrer à sa volonté ses propres biens.
Alors, <i>comme aujourd'hui</i>, l'administration tenait donc tous les
Français en tutelle, et si l'insolence du mot ne s'était pas encore
produite, on avait du moins déjà la chose.&rsquo; <i>Tocqueville</i>, <i>l'Ancien

favour the establishment of academies; and it is probably to the same
principle that their jurists owe their love of codification. All these
are manifestations of an unwillingness to rely on the general march of

to kings themselves, should be forced upon any.&rsquo;</p></div>

printed a curious extract from a lamentation over the destruction of

middle of the fifteenth century, and called the Turnament of Tottenham,
in which the follies of chivalry are admirably ridiculed. See <i>Warton's

amount of evidence, supplied by competent and impartial observers.
Addison, who was a lenient as well as an able judge, and who had lived
much among the French, calls them &lsquo;the vainest nation in the world.&rsquo;

français, c'est l'amour propre;&rsquo; and Ségur (<i>Souvenirs</i>, vol. i. pp. 73,
74), &lsquo;car en France l'amour propre, ou, si on le veut, la vanité, est de
toutes les passions la plus irritable.&rsquo; It is moreover stated, that
phrenological observations prove that the French are vainer than the
English. <i>Combe's Elements of Phrenology</i>, 6th edit. Edinb. 1845, p. 90;
and a partial recognition of the same fact in <i>Broussais</i>, <i>Cours de

the vanity of the French, see <i>Tocqueville</i>, <i>l'Ancien Régime</i>, p. 148;

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_341_341" id="Footnote_341_341"></a><a href="#FNanchor_341_341"><span class="label">[341]</span></a> The relation between chivalry and duelling has been
noticed by several writers; and in France, where the chivalric spirit
was not completely destroyed until the Revolution, we find occasional
traces of this connexion even in the reign of Louis XVI. See, for
instance, in <i>Mém. de Lafayette</i>, vol. i. p. 86, a curious letter in
regard to chivalry and duelling in 1778. In England there is, I believe,
no evidence of even a single private duel being fought earlier than the
sixteenth century, and there were not many till the latter half of
Elizabeth's reign; but in France the custom arose early in the fifteenth
century, and in the sixteenth it became usual for the seconds to fight
as well as the principals. Compare <i>Montlosier</i>, <i>Monarc. Franç.</i> vol.
ii. p. 436, with <i>Monteil</i>, <i>Hist. des divers Etats</i>, vol. vi. p. 48.
From that time the love of the French for duelling became quite a
passion until the end of the eighteenth century, when the Revolution, or
rather the circumstances which led to the Revolution, caused its
comparative cessation. Some idea may be formed of the enormous extent of
this practice formerly in France, by comparing the following passages,
which I have the more pleasure in bringing together, as no one has
written even a tolerable history of duelling, notwithstanding the great
part it once played in European society. <i>De Thou</i>, <i>Hist. Univ.</i> vol.

is very natural) an equal irreverence to the government of the state
too.&rsquo; The Spanish government, perhaps more than any other in Europe, has
understood this relation; and even so late as 1789, an edict of Charles
IV. declared, &lsquo;qu'il y a crime d'hérésie dans tout ce qui tend, ou

sufficiently appreciated by ordinary writers, is a very important study,
because it is the last attempt ever made by the great English families
to establish their authority by force of arms. Mr. Wright says, that
probably all those who took a leading part in it &lsquo;were allied by blood
or intermarriage with the two families of the Percies and Neviles.&rsquo;
<i>Wright's Elizabeth</i>, 1838, vol. i. p. xxxiv.; a valuable work. See
also, in <i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol. i. p. 730, a list of some of those who, in
1571, were attainted on account of this rebellion, and who are said to
be &lsquo;all of the best families in the north of England.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the most complete evidence we have respecting this struggle,
consists of the collection of original documents published in 1840 by
Sir C. Sharpe, under the title of <i>Memorials of the Rebellion of 1569</i>.
They show very clearly the real nature of the outbreak. On 17th November
1569, Sir George Bowes writes, that the complaint of the insurgents was
that &lsquo;there was certaine counsellors cropen&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i> crept) &lsquo;in aboute
the prince, which had excluded the nobility from the prince,&rsquo; &amp;c.,
<i>Memorials</i>, p. 42; and the editor's note says that this is one of the
charges made in all the proclamations by the earls. Perhaps the most
curious proof of how notorious the policy of Elizabeth had become, is
contained in a friendly letter from Sussex to Cecil, dated 5th January
1569 (<i>Memorials</i>, p. 137), one paragraph of which begins, &lsquo;Of late
years few young noblemen have been employed in service.&rsquo;</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">THE ENERGY OF THE PROTECTIVE SPIRIT IN FRANCE EXPLAINS THE
FAILURE OF THE FRONDE. COMPARISON BETWEEN THE FRONDE
AND THE CONTEMPORARY ENGLISH REBELLION.</div>

<p>The object of the last chapter was to enquire into the
origin of the protective spirit. From the evidence there
collected, it appears that this spirit was first organized
into a distinct secular form at the close of the dark ages;
but that, owing to circumstances which then arose, it
was, from the beginning, much less powerful in England
than in France. It has likewise appeared that, in our
country, it continued to lose ground; while in France,
it early in the fourteenth century assumed a new shape,
and gave rise to a centralizing movement, manifested
not only in the civil and political institutions, but also
in the social and literary habits of the French nation.
Thus far we seem to have cleared the way for a proper
understanding of the history of the two countries; and
I now purpose to follow this up a little further, and
point out how this difference explains the discrepancy
between the civil wars of England, and those which at
the same time broke out in France.</p>

<p>Among the obvious circumstances connected with
the Great English Rebellion, the most remarkable is,
that it was a war of classes as well as of factions.
From the beginning of the contest, the yeomanry and
traders adhered to the parliament;<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> the nobles and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
clergy rallied round the throne.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> And the name given
to the two parties, of Roundheads<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> and Cavaliers,<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
proves that the true nature of this opposition was
generally known. It proves that men were aware that
a question was at issue, upon which England was
divided, not so much by the particular interests of individuals,
as by the general interests of the classes to
which those individuals belonged.</p>

<p>But in the history of the French rebellion, there is
no trace of so large a division. The objects of the war
were in both countries precisely the same: the machinery
by which those objects were attained was very
different. The Fronde was like our Rebellion, insomuch
that it was a struggle of the parliament against the
crown; an attempt to secure liberty, and raise up a
barrier against the despotism of government.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> So far,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and so long, as we merely take a view of political objects,
the parallel is complete. But the social and intellectual
antecedents of the French being very different from
those of the English, it necessarily followed that the
shape which the rebellion took should likewise be different,
even though the motives were the same. If we
examine this divergence a little nearer, we shall find
that it is connected with the circumstance I have
already noticed&mdash;namely, that in England a war for
liberty was accompanied by a war of classes, while in
France there was no war of classes at all. From this
it resulted, that in France the rebellion, being merely
political, and not, as with us, also social, took less hold
of the public mind: it was unaccompanied by those
feelings of insubordination, in the absence of which
freedom has always been impossible; and, striking no
root into the national character, it could not save the
country from that servile state into which, a few years
later, it, under the government of Louis XIV. rapidly
fell.</p>

<p>That our Great Rebellion was, in its external form, a
war of classes, is one of those palpable facts which lie
on the surface of history. At first, the parliament<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> did
indeed attempt to draw over to their side some of the
nobles; and in this they for a time succeeded. But as
the struggle advanced, the futility of this policy became
evident. In the natural order of the great movement,
the nobles grew more loyal;<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> the parliament grew more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
democratic.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> And when it was clearly seen that both
parties were determined either to conquer or to die, this
antagonism of classes was too clearly marked to be misunderstood;
the perception which each had of its own
interests being sharpened by the magnitude of the stake
for which they contended.</p>

<p>For, without burdening this Introduction with what
may be read in our common histories, it will be sufficient
to remind the reader of a few of the conspicuous events
of that time. Just before the war began, the Earl of
Essex was appointed general of the parliamentary forces,
with the Earl of Bedford as his lieutenant. A commission
to raise troops was likewise given to the Earl of
Manchester,<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> the only man of high rank against whom
Charles had displayed open enmity.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Notwithstanding
these marks of confidence, the nobles, in whom parliament
was at first disposed to trust, could not avoid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
showing the old leaven of their order.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> The Earl of
Essex so conducted himself, as to inspire the popular
party with the greatest apprehensions of his treachery;<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
and when the defence of London was intrusted to Waller,
he so obstinately refused to enter the name of that able
officer in the commission, that the Commons were
obliged to insert it by virtue of their own authority, and
in spite of their own general.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> The Earl of Bedford,
though he had received a military command, did not
hesitate to abandon those who conferred it. This apostate
noble fled from Westminster to Oxford: but finding
that the king, who never forgave his enemies, did not
receive him with the favour he expected, he returned
to London; where, though he was allowed to remain
in safety, it could not be supposed that he should again
experience the confidence of parliament.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Such examples as these were not likely to lessen the
distrust which both parties felt for each other. It soon
became evident that a war of classes was unavoidable,
and that the rebellion of the parliament against the
king must be reinforced by a rebellion of the people
against the nobles.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> To this the popular party, whatever
may have been their first intention, now willingly
agreed. In 1645 they enacted a law, by which not
only the Earl of Essex and the Earl of Manchester lost
their command, but all members of either house were
made incapable of military service.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> And, only a week
after the execution of the king, they formally took away
the legislative power of the peers; putting at the same
time on record their memorable opinion, that the House
of Lords is &lsquo;useless, dangerous, and ought to be
abolished.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>But we may find proofs still more convincing of the
true character of the English rebellion, if we consider
who those were by whom it was accomplished. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
will show us the democratic nature of a movement which
lawyers and antiquaries have vainly attempted to shelter
under the form of constitutional precedent. Our great
rebellion was the work, not of men who looked behind,
but of men who looked before. To attempt to trace it
to personal and temporary causes; to ascribe this unparalleled
outbreak to a dispute respecting ship-money,
or to a quarrel about the privileges of parliament, can
only suit the habits of those historians who see no
further than the preamble of a statute, or the decision
of a judge. Such writers forget that the trial of Hampden,
and the impeachment of the five members, could
have produced no effect on the country, unless the
people had already been prepared, and unless the spirit
of inquiry and insubordination had so increased the
discontents of men, as to put them in a state, where,
the train being laid, the slightest spark sufficed to kindle
a conflagration.</p>

<p>The truth is, that the rebellion was an outbreak of
the democratic spirit. It was the political form of a
movement, of which the Reformation was the religious
form. As the Reformation was aided, not by men in
high ecclesiastical offices, not by great cardinals or
wealthy bishops, but by men filling the lowest and most
subordinate posts, just so was the English rebellion a
movement from below, an uprising from the foundations,
or as some will have it, the dregs of society. The
few persons of high rank who adhered to the popular
cause were quickly discarded, and the ease and rapidity
with which they fell off was a clear indication of the
turn that things were taking. Directly the army was
freed from its noble leaders, and supplied with officers
drawn from the lower classes, the fortune of war
changed, the royalists were every where defeated, and
the king made prisoner by his own subjects. Between
his capture and execution, the two most important political
events were his abduction by Joyce, and the forcible
expulsion from the House of Commons of those members
who were thought likely to interfere in his favour.
Both these decisive steps were taken, and indeed only
could have been taken, by men of great personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
influence, and of a bold and resolute spirit. Joyce, who
carried off the king, and who was highly respected in
the army, had, however, been recently a common
working tailor;<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> while Colonel Pride, whose name is
preserved in history as having purged the House of
Commons of the malignants, was about on a level with
Joyce, since his original occupation was that of a drayman.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
The tailor and the drayman were, in that age,
strong enough to direct the course of public affairs, and
to win for themselves a conspicuous position in the
state. After the execution of Charles, the same tendency
was displayed, the old monarchy being destroyed,
that small but active party known as the fifth-monarchy
men increased in importance, and for a time exercised
considerable influence. Their three principal and most
distinguished members were Venner, Tuffnel, and Okey.
Venner, who was the leader, was a wine-cooper;<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
Tuffnel, who was second in command, was a carpenter;<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
and Okey, though he became a colonel, had filled the
menial office of stoker in an Islington brewery.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>Nor are these to be regarded as exceptional cases. In
that period, promotion depended solely on merit; and
if a man had ability he was sure to rise, no matter what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
his birth or former avocations might have been. Cromwell
himself was a brewer;<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> and Colonel Jones, his
brother-in-law, had been servant to a private gentleman.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>
Deane was the servant of a tradesman; but he
became an admiral, and was made one of the commissioners
of the navy.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> Colonel Goffe had been apprentice
to a drysalter;<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> Major-general Whalley had been
apprentice to a draper.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Skippon, a common soldier
who had received no education,<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> was appointed commander
of the London militia; he was raised to the
office of sergeant-major-general of the army; he was
declared commander-in-chief in Ireland; and he became
one of the fourteen members of Cromwell's council.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
Two of the lieutenants of the Tower were Berkstead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and Tichborne. Berkstead was a pedlar, or at all events
a hawker of small wares;<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> and Tichborne, who was a
linendraper, not only received the lieutenancy of the
Tower, but became a colonel, and a member of the
committee of state in 1655, and of the council of state
in 1659.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Other trades were equally successful; the
highest prizes being open to all men, provided they
displayed the requisite capacity. Colonel Harvey was
a silk-mercer;<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> so was Colonel Rowe;<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> so also was
Colonel Venn.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> Salway had been apprentice to a
grocer, but, being an able man, he rose to the rank of
major in the army; he received the king's remembrancer's
office; and in 1659 he was appointed by
parliament a member of the council of state.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Around
that council-board were also gathered Bond the draper,<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>
and Cawley the brewer;<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> while by their side we find
John Berners, who is said to have been a private servant,<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>
and Cornelius Holland, who is known to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
been a servant, and who was, indeed, formerly a link-boy.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
Among others who were now favoured and
promoted to offices of trust, were Packe the woollen-draper,<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>
Pury the weaver,<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> and Pemble the tailor.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
The parliament which was summoned in 1653 is still
remembered as Barebone's parliament, being so called
after one of its most active members, whose name was
Barebone, and who was a leather-seller in Fleet Street.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>

<p>Such were the leaders of the English rebellion, or to
speak more properly, such were the instruments by
which the rebellion was consummated.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> If we now
turn to France, we shall clearly see the difference
between the feelings and temper of the two nations. In
that country, the old protective spirit still retained its
activity; and the people, being kept in a state of pupilage,
had not acquired those habits of self-command and
self-reliance, by which alone great things can be effected.
They had been so long accustomed to look with timid
reverence to the upper classes, that, even when they
rose in arms, they could not throw off the ideas of submission
which were quickly discarded by our ancestors.
The influence of the higher ranks was, in England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
constantly diminishing; in France, it was scarcely
impaired. Hence it happened that, although the
English and French rebellions were contemporary, and,
in their origin, aimed at precisely the same objects,
they were distinguished by one most important difference.
This was, that the English rebels were headed
by popular leaders; the French rebels by noble leaders.
The bold and sturdy habits which had long been cultivated
in England, enabled the middle and lower classes
to supply their own chiefs out of their own ranks. In
France such chiefs were not to be found; simply because,
owing to the protective spirit, such habits had
not been cultivated. While, therefore, in our island,
the functions of civil government, and of war, were
conducted with conspicuous ability, and complete success,
by butchers, by bakers, by brewers, by cobblers,
and by tinkers, the struggle which, at the same moment,
was going on in France, presented an appearance
totally different. In that country, the rebellion was
headed by men of a far higher standing; men, indeed,
of the longest and most illustrious lineage. There, to
be sure, was a display of unexampled splendour; a
galaxy of rank, a noble assemblage of aristocratic insurgents
and titled demagogues. There was the Prince
de Condé, the Prince de Conti, the Prince de Marsillac,
the Duke de Bouillon, the Duke de Beaufort, the Duke
de Longueville, the Duke de Chevreuse, the Duke de
Nemours, the Duke de Luynes, the Duke de Brissac,
the Duke d'Elb&oelig;uf, the Duke de Candale, the Duke de
la Tremouille, the Marquis de la Boulaye, the Marquis
de Laigues, the Marquis de Noirmoutier, the Marquis
de Vitry, the Marquis de Fosseuse, the Marquis de
Sillery, the Marquis d'Estissac, the Marquis d'Hocquincourt,
the Count de Rantzau, the Count de Montresor.</p>

<p>These were the leaders of the Fronde;<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> and the
mere announcement of their names indicate the difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
between the French and English rebellions. And,
in consequence of this difference, there followed some
results, which are well worth the attention of those
writers who, in their ignorance of the progress of human
affairs, seek to uphold that aristocratic power, which,
fortunately for the interests of mankind, has long been
waning; and which, during the last seventy years has,
in the most civilized countries, received such severe and
repeated shocks, that its ultimate fate is hardly a matter
respecting which much doubt can now be entertained.</p>

<p>The English rebellion was headed by men, whose
tastes, habits, and associations, being altogether popular,
formed a bond of sympathy between them and the
people, and preserved the union of the whole party. In
France the sympathy was very weak, and therefore, the
union was very precarious. What sort of sympathy
could there be between the mechanic and the peasant,
toiling for their daily bread, and the rich and dissolute
noble, whose life was passed in those idle and frivolous
pursuits which debased his mind, and made his order a
byword and a reproach among the nations? To talk
of sympathy existing between the two classes is a manifest
absurdity, and most assuredly would have been
deemed an insult by those high-born men, who treated
their inferiors with habitual and insolent contempt. It
is true, that, from causes which have been already
stated, the people did, unhappily for themselves, look
up to those above them with the greatest veneration;<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>
but every page of French history proves how unworthily
this feeling was reciprocated, and in how complete a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
thraldom the lower classes were kept. While, therefore,
the French, from their long-established habits of
dependence, were become incapable of conducting their
own rebellion, and, on that account, were obliged to
place themselves under the command of their nobles,
this very necessity confirmed the servility which caused
it; and thus stunting the growth of freedom, prevented
the nation from effecting, by their civil wars, those
great things which we, in England, were able to bring
about by ours.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is only necessary to read the French literature
of the seventeenth century, to see the incompatibility
of the two classes, and the utter hopelessness of
fusing into one party the popular and aristocratic spirit.
While the object of the people was to free themselves
from the yoke, the object of the nobles was merely to
find new sources of excitement,<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> and minister to that
personal vanity for which, as a body, they have always
been notorious. As this is a department of history that
has been little studied, it will be interesting to collect a
few instances, which will illustrate the temper of the
French aristocracy, and will show what sort of honours,
and what manner of distinctions, those were which this
powerful class was most anxious to obtain.</p>

<p>That the objects chiefly coveted were of a very trifling
description, will be anticipated by whoever has studied
the effect which, in an immense majority of minds,
hereditary distinctions produce upon personal character.
How pernicious such distinctions are, may be clearly
seen in the history of all the European aristocracies;
and in the notorious fact, that none of them have preserved
even a mediocrity of talent, except in countries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
where they are frequently invigorated by the infusion
of plebeian blood, and their order strengthened by the
accession of those masculine energies which are natural
to men who make their own position, but cannot be
looked for in men whose position is made for them.
For, when the notion is once firmly implanted in the
mind, that the source of honour is from without, rather
than from within, it must invariably happen that the
possession of external distinction will be preferred to
the sense of internal power. In such cases, the majesty
of the human intellect, and the dignity of human knowledge,
are considered subordinate to those mock and
spurious gradations by which weak men measure the
degrees of their own littleness. Hence it is, that the
real precedence of things becomes altogether reversed;
that which is trifling is valued more than that which is
great; and the mind is enervated by conforming to a
false standard of merit, which its own prejudices have
raised. On this account, they are evidently in the wrong
who reproach the nobles with their pride, as if it were
a characteristic of their order. The truth is, that if
pride were once established among them, their extinction
would rapidly follow. To talk of the pride of
hereditary rank, is a contradiction in terms. Pride
depends on the consciousness of self-applause; vanity
is fed by the applause of others. Pride is a reserved
and lofty passion, which disdains those external distinctions
that vanity eagerly grasps. The proud man
sees in his own mind, the source of his own dignity;
which, as he well knows, can be neither increased or
diminished by any acts except those which proceed
solely from himself. The vain man, restless, insatiable,
and always craving after the admiration of his contemporaries,
must naturally make great account of those
external marks, those visible tokens, which, whether
they be decorations or titles, strike directly on the
senses, and thus captivate the vulgar, to whose understandings
they are immediately obvious. This, therefore,
being the great distinction, that pride looks within,
while vanity looks without, it is clear that when a man
values himself for a rank which he inherited by chance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
without exertion, and without merit, it is a proof, not
of pride, but of vanity, and of vanity of the most despicable
kind. It is a proof that such a man has no
sense of real dignity, no idea of what that is in which
alone all greatness consists. What marvel if, to minds
of this sort, the most insignificant trifles should swell into
matters of the highest importance? What marvel if such
empty understandings should be busied with ribbons,
and stars, and crosses; if this noble should yearn after
the Garter, and that noble pine for the Golden Fleece;
if one man should long to carry a wand in the precincts
of the court, and another man to fill an office in the
royal household; while the ambition of a third is to
make his daughter a maid-of-honour, or to raise his
wife to be mistress of the robes?</p>

<p>We, seeing these things, ought not to be surprised
that the French nobles, in the seventeenth century,
displayed, in their intrigues and disputes, a frivolity,
which, though redeemed by occasional exceptions, is the
natural characteristic of every hereditary aristocracy.
A few examples of this will suffice to give the reader
some idea of the tastes and temper of that powerful
class which, during several centuries, retarded the progress
of French civilization.</p>

<p>Of all the questions on which the French nobles were
divided, the most important was that touching the right
of sitting in the royal presence. This was considered to
be a matter of such gravity, that, in comparison with it,
a mere struggle for liberty faded into insignificance.
And what made it still more exciting to the minds of the
nobles was, the extreme difficulty with which this great
social problem was beset. According to the ancient
etiquette of the French court, if a man were a duke, his
wife might sit in the presence of the queen; but if his
rank were inferior, even if he were a marquis, no such
liberty could be allowed.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> So far, the rule was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
simple, and, to the duchesses themselves, highly agreeable.
But the marquises, the counts, and the other
illustrious nobles, were uneasy at this invidious distinction,
and exerted all their energies to procure for
their own wives the same honour. This the dukes
strenuously resisted; but, owing to circumstances which
unfortunately are not fully understood, an innovation
was made in the reign of Louis XIII., and the privilege
of sitting in the same room with the queen was conceded
to the female members of the Bouillon family.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> In consequence
of this evil precedent, the question became
seriously complicated, since other members of the aristocracy
considered that the purity of their descent gave
them claims nowise inferior to those of the house of
Bouillon, whose antiquity, they said, had been grossly
exaggerated. The contest which ensued, had the effect
of breaking up the nobles into two hostile parties, one of
which sought to preserve that exclusive privilege in
which the other wished to participate. To reconcile
these rival pretensions, various expedients were suggested;
but all were in vain, and the court, during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
administration of Mazarin, being pressed by the fear of
a rebellion, showed symptoms of giving way, and of
yielding to the inferior nobles the point they so ardently
desired. In 1648 and 1649, the queen-regent, acting
under the advice of her council, formally conceded the
right of sitting in the royal presence to the three most
distinguished members of the lower aristocracy, namely,
the Countess de Fleix, Madame de Pons, and the Princess
de Marsillac.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Scarcely had this decision been
promulgated, when the princes of the blood and the
peers of the realm were thrown into the greatest agitation.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
They immediately summoned to the capital those
members of their own order who were interested in repelling
this daring aggression, and, forming themselves
into an assembly, they at once adopted measures to
vindicate their ancient rights.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> On the other hand, the
inferior nobles, flushed by their recent success, insisted
that the concession just made should be raised into a
precedent; and that, as the honour of being seated in
the presence of majesty had been conceded to the house
of Foix, in the person of the Countess de Fleix, it should
likewise be granted to all those who could prove that
their ancestry was equally illustrious.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> The greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
confusion now arose; and both sides urgently insisting
on their own claims, there was, for many months, imminent
danger lest the question should be decided by an
appeal to the sword.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> But as the higher nobles, though
less numerous than their opponents, were more powerful,
the dispute was finally settled in their favour. The
queen sent to their assembly a formal message, which
was conveyed by four of the marshals of France, and in
which she promised to revoke those privileges, the concession
of which had given such offence to the most
illustrious members of the French aristocracy. At the
same time, the marshals not only pledged themselves as
responsible for the promise of the queen, but undertook
to sign an agreement that they would personally superintend
its execution.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> The nobles, however, who felt
that they had been aggrieved in their most tender point,
were not yet satisfied, and, to appease them, it was
necessary that the atonement should be as public as the
injury. It was found necessary, before they would
peaceably disperse, that government should issue a document,
signed by the queen-regent, and by the four
secretaries of state,<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> in which the favours granted to
the unprivileged nobility were withdrawn, and the
much-cherished honour of sitting in the royal presence
was taken away from the Princess de Marsillac, from
Madame de Pons, and from the Countess de Fleix.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>These were the subjects which occupied the minds
and wasted the energies, of the French nobles, while
their country was distracted by civil war, and while
questions were at issue of the greatest importance&mdash;questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
concerning the liberty of the nation, and the
reconstruction of the government.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> It is hardly necessary
to point out how unfit such men must have been
to head the people in their arduous struggle, and how
immense was the difference between them and the
leaders of the great English Rebellion. The causes of
the failure of the Fronde are, indeed, obvious, when we
consider that its chiefs were drawn from that very
class respecting whose tastes and feelings some evidence
has just been given.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> How that evidence might be
almost indefinitely extended, is well known to readers
of the French memoirs of the seventeenth century&mdash;a
class of works which, being mostly written either
by the nobles or their adherents, supplies the best
materials from which an opinion may be formed. In
looking into these authorities, where such matters are
related with a becoming sense of their importance, we
find the greatest difficulties and disputes arising as to
who was to have an arm-chair at court;<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> who was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>

he ought to sit above him.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> These were the great
questions of the day: while, as if to exhaust every form
of absurdity, the most serious misunderstandings arose
as to who should have the honour of giving the king
his napkin as he ate his meals<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> and who was to enjoy

her shift.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be thought that I owe some apology
to the reader for obtruding upon his notice these miserable
disputes respecting matters which, however despicable
they now appear, were once valued by men not
wholly devoid of understanding. But, it should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
remembered that their occurrence, and above all, the
importance formerly attached to them, is part of the
history of the French mind; and they are therefore to
be estimated, not according to their intrinsic dignity,
but according to the information they supply respecting
a state of things which has now passed away. Events
of this sort, though neglected by ordinary historians,
are among the staff and staple of history. Not only do
they assist in bringing before our minds the age to
which they refer, but in a philosophic point of view they
are highly important. They are part of the materials
from which we may generalize the laws of that great
protective spirit, which in different periods assumes
different shapes; but which, whatever its form may be,
always owes its power to the feeling of veneration as
opposed to the feeling of independence. How natural
this power is, in certain stages of society, becomes
evident if we examine the basis on which veneration is
itself supported. The origin of veneration is wonder
and fear. These two passions, either alone or combined,
are the ordinary source of veneration; and the
way in which they arise is obvious. We wonder because
we are ignorant, and we fear because we are
weak. It is therefore natural, that in former times,
when men were more ignorant and more weak than
they now are, they should likewise have been more
given to veneration, more inclined to those habits of
reverence, which if carried into religion, cause superstition,
and if carried into politics, cause despotism.
In the ordinary march of society, those evils are remedied
by that progress of knowledge, which at once
lessens our ignorance and increases our resources: in
other words, which diminishes our proneness to wonder
and to fear, and thus weakening our feelings of veneration,
strengthens, in the same proportion, our feelings
of independence. But in France, this natural tendency
was, as we have already seen, counteracted by an opposite
tendency; so that while, on the one hand, the
protective spirit was enfeebled by the advance of knowledge,
it was, on the other hand, invigorated by those
social and political circumstances which I have attempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to trace; and by virtue of which, each class
exercising great power over the one below it, the
subordination and subserviency of the whole were
completely maintained. Hence the mind became accustomed
to look upwards, and to rely, not on its own
resources, but on the resources of others. Hence that
pliant and submissive disposition, for which the French,
until the eighteenth century, were always remarkable.
Hence, too, that inordinate respect for the opinions of
others, on which vanity, as one of their national characteristics,
is founded.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> For, the feelings of vanity and of
veneration have evidently this in common, that they
induce each man to measure his actions by a standard
external to himself; while the opposite feelings of
pride and of independence would make him prefer that
internal standard which his own mind alone can supply.
The result of all this was, that when, in the middle of
the seventeenth century, the intellectual movement
stimulated the French to rebellion, its effect was neutralized
by that social tendency which, even in the
midst of the struggle, kept alive the habits of their old
subservience. Thus it was that, while the war went on,
there still remained a constant inclination on the part
of the people to look up to the nobles, on the part of
the nobles to look up to the crown. Both classes
relied upon what they saw immediately above them.
The people believed that without the nobles there was
no safety; the nobles believed that without the crown
there was no honour. In the case of the nobles, this
opinion can hardly be blamed; for as their distinctions
proceed from the crown, they have a direct interest in
upholding the ancient notion that the sovereign is the
fountain of honour. They have a direct interest in
that preposterous doctrine, according to which, the true
source of honour being overlooked, our attention is
directed to an imaginary source, by whose operation it
is believed, that in a moment, and at the mere will of a
prince, the highest honours may be conferred upon the
meanest men. This, indeed, is but part of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
scheme to create distinctions for which nature has
given no warrant; to substitute a superiority which is
conventional for that which is real; and thus try to
raise little minds above the level of great ones. The
utter failure, and, as society advances, the eventual
cessation of all such attempts, is certain; but it is
evident, that as long as the attempts are made, they
who profit by them must be inclined to value those
from whom they proceed. Unless counteracting circumstances
interpose, there must be between the two
parties that sympathy which is caused by the memory
of past favours, and the hope of future ones. In France,
this natural feeling being strengthened by that protective
spirit which induced men to cling to those
above them, it is not strange that the nobles, even in
the midst of their turbulence, should seek the slightest
favours of the crown with an eagerness of which some
examples have just been given. They had been so
long accustomed to look up to the sovereign as the
source of their own dignity, that they believed there
was some hidden dignity even in his commonest
actions; so that, to their minds, it was a matter of the
greatest importance which of them should hand him
his napkin, which of them should hold his basin, and
which of them should put on his shirt.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> It is not,
however, for the sake of casting ridicule upon these
idle and frivolous men, that I have collected evidence
respecting the disputes with which they were engrossed.
So far from this, they are rather to be pitied than
blamed: they acted according to their instincts; they
even exerted such slender abilities as nature had given
to them. But we may well feel for that great country
whose interests depended on their care. And it is
solely in reference to the fate of the French people
that the historian need trouble himself with the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of the French nobles. At the same time, evidence of
this sort, by disclosing the tendencies of the old nobility,
displays in one of its most active forms that protective
and aristocratic spirit, of which they know little who
only know it in its present reduced and waning condition.
Such facts are to be regarded as the symptoms
of a cruel disease, by which Europe is indeed still
afflicted, but which we now see only in a very mitigated
form, and of whose native virulence no one can have an
idea, unless he has studied it in those early stages,
when, raging uncontrolled, it obtained such a mastery
as to check the growth of liberty, stop the progress
of nations, and dwarf the energies of the human
mind.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to trace at greater length the
way in which France and England diverged from each
other, or to point out what I hope will henceforth be
considered the obvious difference between the civil
wars in the two countries. It is evident that the low-born
and plebeian leaders of our rebellion could have no
sympathy with those matters which perplexed the
understanding of the great French nobles. Men like
Cromwell and his co-adjutors were not much versed in
the mysteries of genealogy, or in the subtleties of heraldic
lore. They had paid small attention to the etiquette of
courts; they had not even studied the rules of precedence.
All this was foreign to their design. On the
other hand, what they did was done thoroughly. They
knew that they had a great work to perform; and they
performed it well.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> They had risen in arms against a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
corrupt and despotic government, and they would not
stay their hands until they had pulled down those who
were in high places; until they had not only removed
the evil, but had likewise chastised those bad men by
whom the evil was committed. And although in this,
their glorious undertaking, they did undoubtedly display
some of the infirmities to which even the highest
minds are subject; we, at least, ought never to speak
of them but with that unfeigned respect which is due
to those who taught the first great lesson to the kings
of Europe, and who, in language not to be mistaken,
proclaimed to them that the impunity which they had
long enjoyed was now come to an end, and that against
their transgressions the people possessed a remedy,
sharper, and more decisive, than any they had hitherto
ventured to use.</p>

says (<i>Hist. of the Rebellion</i>, p. 514): &lsquo;That violent party, which had
at first cozened the rest into the war, and afterwards obstructed all
the approaches towards peace, found now that they had finished as much
of their work as the tools which they had wrought with could be applied
to, and what remained to be done must be despatched by new workmen.&rsquo;
What these new workmen were, he afterwards explains, p. 641, to be &lsquo;the
most inferior people preferred to all places of trust and profit.&rsquo; Book

that this was foreseen from the beginning. He says, that the popular
party offered command to some of the nobles, &lsquo;not that they had any
respect for the lords, whom shortly they intended to turn out and to
level with the commoners, but that they might poison them with their own
venom, and rise to greater authority by drawing more over to their
side.&rsquo; <i>Bates's Account of the late Troubles in England</i>, part i. p. 76.
Lord North too supposes, that almost immediately after the war began, it
was determined to dissolve the House of Lords. See <i>Somers Tracts</i>, vol.

about 1649, the army was commanded by &lsquo;colonels and superior officers,
who lord it in their gilt coaches, rich apparel, costly feastings;
though some of them led dray-horses, wore leather-pelts, and were never
able to name their own fathers or mothers.&rsquo; <i>Hist. of Independ.</i> part
ii. p. 244. The <i>Mercurius Rusticus</i>, 1647, says, &lsquo;Chelmsford was
governed by a tinker, two cobblers, two tailors, two pedlars.&rsquo;
<i>Southey's Commonplace Book</i>, third series, 1850, p. 430. And, at p.
434, another work, in 1647, makes a similar statement in regard to
Cambridge; while Lord Holles assures us, that &lsquo;most of the colonels and
officers (were) mean tradesmen, brewers, taylors, goldsmiths,
shoe-makers, and the like.&rsquo; <i>Holles's Memoirs</i>, p. 149. When Whitelocke
was in Sweden in 1653, the prætor of one of the towns abused the

&lsquo;Jamais l'exemple des grands n'a été aussi contagieux ailleurs qu'en
France; on dirait qu'ils ont le malheureux privilège de tout justifier.&rsquo;
Rivarol, though his opinions on other points were entirely opposed to
those of Mably, says, that, in France, &lsquo;la noblesse est aux yeux du
peuple une espèce de religion, dont les gentilshommes sont les prêtres.&rsquo;

encroachment on the rights of the duchesses under Louis XIII., the case
of Séguier, in <i>Duclos</i>, <i>Mémoires Secrets</i>, vol. i. pp. 360, 361. The
consequences of the innovation were very serious; and Tallemant des
Réaux (<i>Historiettes</i>, vol. iii. pp. 223, 224) mentions a distinguished
lady, of whom he says, &lsquo;Pour satisfaire son ambition, il lui falloit un
tabouret: elle cabale pour épouser le vieux Bouillon La Marck veuf pour
la seconde fois.&rsquo; In this she failed; but, determined not to be baffled,
&lsquo;elle ne se rebute point, et voulant à toute force avoir un tabouret,
elle épouse le fils aîné du duc de Villars: c'est un ridicule de corps
et d'esprit, car il est bossu et quasi imbécile, et gueux par-dessus
cela.&rsquo; This melancholy event happened in 1649.</p></div>

the inconstancy of the people, is admitted by De Retz, by far the ablest
observer of his time: &lsquo;Vous vous étonnerez peut-être de ce que je dis
plus sûr, à cause de l'instabilité du peuple: mais il faut avouer que
celui de Paris se fixe plus aisément qu'aucun autre; et M. de Villeroi,
qui a été le plus habile homme de son siècle, et qui en a parfaitement
connu le naturel dans tout le cours de la ligue, où il le gouverna sous
M. du Maine, a été de ce sentiment. Ce que j'en éprouvois moi-même me le
persuadoit.&rsquo; <i>Mém. de Retz</i>, vol. i. p. 348; a remarkable passage, and

York, to whom, in 1649, &lsquo;la reine fit de grands honneurs, et lui donna

chamber of the king, the matter seems to have been differently arranged;
for Omer Talon (<i>Mém.</i> vol. ii. p. 332) tells us that &lsquo;le duc d'Orléans
n'avoit point de fauteuil, mais un simple siège pliant, à cause que nous

connected with it, gained in France a strength
unknown in England, and caused an essential divergence
between the two countries. To complete the comparison,
it seems necessary to examine how this same
spirit influenced the purely intellectual history of
France as well as its social and political history. For the
ideas of dependence upon which the protective scheme is
based, encouraged a belief that the subordination which
existed in politics and in society ought also to exist in
literature; and that the paternal, inquisitive, and centralizing
system which regulated the material interests
of the country, should likewise regulate the interests
of its knowledge. When, therefore, the Fronde
was finally overthrown, everything was prepared for
that singular intellectual polity which, during fifty
years characterised the reign of Louis XIV., and which
was to French literature what feudalism was to
French politics. In both cases, homage was paid by one
party, and protection and favour accorded by the
other. Every man of letters became a vassal of the
French crown. Every book was written with a view
to the royal favour; and to obtain the patronage of the
king was considered the most decisive proof of intellectual
eminence. The effects produced by this system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
will be examined in the present chapter. The apparent
cause of the system was the personal character of Louis
XIV.; but the real and overruling causes were those
circumstances which I have already pointed out, and
which established in the French mind associations that
remained undisturbed until the eighteenth century. To
invigorate those associations, and to carry them into
every department of life, was the great aim of Louis
XIV.; and in that he was completely successful. It is
on this account that the history of his reign becomes
highly instructive, because we see in it the most remarkable
instance of despotism which has ever occurred;
a despotism of the largest and most comprehensive
kind; a despotism of fifty years over one of the most
civilized people in Europe, who not only bore the yoke
without repining, but submitted with cheerfulness, and
even with gratitude, to him by whom it was imposed.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>What makes this the more strange is, that the reign
of Louis XIV. must be utterly condemned if it is
tried even by the lowest standard of morals, of honour,
or of interest. A coarse and unbridled profligacy,
followed by the meanest and most grovelling superstition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
characterized his private life, while in his
public career he displayed an arrogance and a systematic
perfidy which eventually roused the anger of
all Europe, and brought upon France sharp and signal
retribution. As to his domestic policy, he formed a
strict alliance with the church; and although he resisted
the authority of the Pope, he willingly left his
subjects to be oppressed by the tyranny of the clergy.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
To them he abandoned everything except the exercise
of his own prerogative.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Led on by them, he, from
the moment he assumed the Government, began to
encroach upon those religious liberties of which Henry
IV. had laid the foundation, and which down to this
period had been preserved intact.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> It was at the instigation
of the clergy that he revoked the Edict of Nantes,
by which the principle of toleration had for nearly a
century been incorporated with the law of the land.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>
It was at their instigation that, just before this outrage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
upon the most sacred rights of his subjects, he, in
order to terrify the Protestants into conversion, suddenly
let loose upon them whole troops of dissolute
soldiers, who were allowed to practise the most revolting
cruelties. The frightful barbarities which followed
are related by authentic writers;<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> and of the effect produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
on the material interests of the nation, some idea
may be formed from the fact, that these religious persecutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
cost France half a million of her most industrious
inhabitants, who fled to different parts, taking
with them those habits of labour, and that knowledge
and experience in their respective trades, which had
hitherto been employed in enriching their own country.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>
These things are notorious, they are incontestable, and
they lie on the surface of history. Yet, in the face of
them there are still found men who hold up for admiration
the age of Louis XIV. Although it is well known
that in his reign every vestige of liberty was destroyed;
that the people were weighed down by an insufferable
taxation; that their children were torn from them by
tens of thousands to swell the royal armies; that the
resources of the country were squandered to an unprecedented
extent; that a despotism of the worst kind
was firmly established;&mdash;although all this is universally
admitted, yet there are writers, even in our own day,
who are so infatuated with the glories of literature, as
to balance them against the most enormous crimes, and
who will forgive every injury inflicted by a prince
during whose life there were produced the Letters of
Pascal, the orations of Bossuet, the Comedies of
Molière, and the Tragedies of Racine.</p>

<p>This method of estimating the merits of a sovereign
is, indeed, so rapidly dying away, that I shall not spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
any words in refuting it. But it is connected with a
more widely diffused error respecting the influence of
royal patronage upon national literature. This is a delusion
which men of letters have themselves been the
first to propagate. From the language too many of
them are in the habit of employing, we might be led to
believe that there is some magical power in the smiles
of a king which stimulates the intellect of the fortunate
individual whose heart they are permitted to gladden.
Nor must this be despised as one of those harmless prejudices
that still linger round the person of the sovereign.
It is not only founded on a misconception of the
nature of things, but it is in its practical consequences
very injurious. It is injurious to the independent spirit
which literature should always possess; and it is injurious
to princes themselves, because it strengthens that
vanity of which they generally have too large a share.
Indeed, if we consider the position they now occupy in
the most civilized countries, we shall at once see the
absurdity of an opinion which, in the present state of
knowledge, is unfit to be held by educated men.</p>

<p>From the moment that there was finally abandoned
the theological fiction of the divine right of kings, it
necessarily followed that the respect felt for them
should suffer a corresponding diminution.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> The superstitious
reverence with which they were formerly regarded
is extinct, and at the present day we are no
longer awed by that divinity with which their persons
were once supposed to be hedged.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> The standard,
therefore, by which we should measure them is obvious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
We should applaud their conduct in proportion as they
contribute towards the happiness of the nation over
which they are intrusted with power; but we ought to
remember that, from the manner in which they are
educated, and from the childish homage always paid to
them, their information must be very inaccurate, and
their prejudices very numerous.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> On this account, so
far from expecting that they should be judicious patrons
of literature, or should in any way head their age, we
ought to be satisfied if they do not obstinately oppose
the spirit of their time, and if they do not attempt to
stop the march of society. For, unless the sovereign,
in spite of the intellectual disadvantages of his position,
is a man of very enlarged mind, it must usually happen
that he will reward, not those who are most able, but
those who are most compliant; and that while he
refuses his patronage to a profound and independent
thinker, he will grant it to an author who cherishes
ancient prejudices and defends ancient abuses. In this
way, the practice of conferring on men of letters either
honorary or pecuniary rewards, is agreeable, no doubt,
to those who receive them; but has a manifest tendency
to weaken the boldness and energy of their sentiments,
and therefore to impair the value of their works.
This might be made evident by publishing a list of
those literary pensions which have been granted by
European princes. If this were done, the mischief produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
by these and similar rewards would be clearly
seen. After a careful study of the history of literature,
I think myself authorised to say, that for one instance
in which a sovereign has recompensed a man who is
before his age, there are at least twenty instances of
his recompensing one who is behind his age. The
result is, that in every country where royal patronage
has been long and generally bestowed, the spirit of
literature, instead of being progressive, has become
reactionary. An alliance has been struck up between
those who give and those who receive. By a system of
bounties, there has been artificially engendered a
greedy and necessitous class; who, eager for pensions,
and offices, and titles, have made the pursuit of truth
subordinate to the desire of gain, and have infused
into their writings the prejudices of the court to which
they cling. Hence it is, that the marks of favour have
become the badge of servitude. Hence it is, that the
acquisition of knowledge, by far the noblest of all occupations,
an occupation which of all others raises the
dignity of man, has been debased to the level of a common
profession, where the chances of success are
measured by the number of rewards, and where the
highest honours are in the gift of whoever happens to
be the minister or sovereign of the day.</p>

<p>This tendency forms of itself a decisive objection to
the views of those who wish to entrust the executive
government with the means of rewarding literary men.
But there is also another objection, in some respects
still more serious. Every nation which is allowed to
pursue its course uncontrolled, will easily satisfy the
wants of its own intellect, and will produce such a
literature as is best suited to its actual condition. And
it is evidently for the interest of all classes that the
production shall not be greater than the want; that the
supply shall not exceed the demand. It is, moreover,
necessary to the well-being of society that a healthy
proportion should be kept up between the intellectual
classes and the practical classes. It is necessary that
there should be a certain ratio between those who are
most inclined to think, and those who are most inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to act. If we were all authors, our material interests
would suffer; if we were all men of business, our mental
pleasures would be abridged. In the first case,
we should be famished philosophers; in the other case,
we should be wealthy fools. Now, it is obvious that,
according to the commonest principles of human action
the relative numbers of these two classes will be
adjusted, without effort, by the natural, or, as we call
it, the spontaneous movement of society. But if a
government takes upon itself to pension literary men,
it disturbs this movement; it troubles the harmony of
things. This is the unavoidable result of that spirit of
interference, or, as it is termed, protection, by which
every country has been greatly injured. If, for instance,
a fund were set apart by the state for rewarding
butchers and tailors, it is certain that the number of
those useful men would be needlessly augmented. If
another fund is appropriated for the literary classes, it is
as certain that men of letters will increase more rapidly
than the exigencies of the country require. In both
cases, an artificial stimulus will produce an unhealthy
action. Surely, food and clothes are as necessary for
the body as literature is for the mind. Why, then,
should we call upon government to encourage those who
write our books, any more than to encourage those
who kill our mutton and mend our garments? The
truth is, that the intellectual march of society is, in
this respect, exactly analogous to its physical march.
In some instances a forced supply may, indeed, create
an unnatural want. But this is an artificial state of
things, which indicates a diseased action. In a healthy
condition, it is not the supply which causes the want,
but it is the want which gives rise to the supply. To
suppose, therefore, that an increase of authors would
necessarily be followed by a diffusion of knowledge, is as
if we were to suppose that an increase of butchers must
be followed by a diffusion of food. This is not the way
in which things are ordered. Men must have appetite
before they will eat; they must have money before
they can buy; they must be inquisitive before they
will read. The two great principles which move the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
world are, the love of wealth and the love of knowledge.
These two principles respectively represent and govern
the two most important classes into which every civilized
country is divided. What a government gives to
one of these classes, it must take from the other. What
it gives to literature, it must take from wealth. This
can never be done to any great extent, without entailing
the most ruinous consequences. For, the natural
proportions of society being destroyed, society itself will
be thrown into confusion. While men of letters are
protected, men of industry will be depressed. The
lower classes can count for little in the eyes of those to
whom literature is the first consideration. The idea of
the liberty of the people will be discouraged; their
persons will be oppressed; their labour will be taxed.
The arts necessary to life will be despised, in order that
those which embellish life may be favoured. The many
will be ruined, that the few may be pleased. While
every thing is splendid above, all will be rotten below.
Fine pictures, noble palaces, touching dramas&mdash;these
may for a time be produced in profusion, but it will be
at the cost of the heart and strength of the nation.
Even the class for whom the sacrifice has been made,
will soon decay. Poets may continue to sing the
praises of the prince who has bought them with his
gold. It is, however, certain that men who begin by
losing their independence, will end by losing their
energy. Their intellect must be robust indeed, if it
does not wither in the sickly atmosphere of a court.
Their attention being concentrated on their master,
they insensibly contract those habits of servility which
are suited to their position; and, as the range of their
sympathies is diminished, the use and action of their
genius become impaired. To them submission is a
custom, and servitude a pleasure. In their hands,
literature soon loses its boldness, tradition is appealed
to as the ground of truth, and the spirit of inquiry is
extinguished. Then it is, that there comes one of
those sad moments in which, no outlet being left for
public opinion, the minds of men are unable to find a
vent; their discontents, having no voice, slowly rankle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
into a deadly hatred; their passions accumulate in
silence, until at length, losing all patience, they are
goaded into one of those terrible revolutions, by which
they humble the pride of their rulers, and carry retribution
even into the heart of the palace.</p>

<p>The truth of this picture is well known to those who
have studied the history of Louis XIV., and the connection
between it and the French Revolution. That
prince adopted, during his long reign, the mischievous
practice of rewarding literary men with large sums of
money, and of conferring on them numerous marks of
personal favour. As this was done for more than half
a century; and as the wealth which he thus unscrupulously
employed was of course taken from his other
subjects, we can find no better illustration of the results
which such patronage is likely to produce. He,
indeed, has the merit of organizing into a system that
protection of literature which some are so anxious to
restore. What the effect of this was upon the general
interests of knowledge, we shall presently see. But its
effect upon authors themselves should be particularly
attended to by those men of letters who, with little
regard to their own dignity, are constantly reproaching
the English government for neglecting the profession
of which they themselves are members. In no age
have literary men been awarded with such profuseness
as in the reign of Louis XIV.; and in no age have they
been so mean-spirited, so servile, so utterly unfit to
fulfil their great vocation as the apostles of knowledge
and the missionaries of truth. The history of the most
celebrated authors of that time proves that, notwithstanding
their acquirements, and the power of their
minds, they were unable to resist the surrounding corruption.
To gain the favour of the king, they sacrificed
that independent spirit which should have been dearer to
them than life. They gave away the inheritance of
genius; they sold their birthright for a mess of pottage.
What happened then, would under the same circumstances
happen now. A few eminent thinkers may be
able for a certain time to resist the pressure of their
age. But, looking at mankind generally, society can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
have no hold on any class except through the medium
of their interests. It behoves, therefore, every people
to take heed, that the interests of literary men are on
their side rather than on the side of their rulers.
For, literature is the representative of intellect, which
is progressive; government is the representative of
order, which is stationary. As long as these two great
powers are separate, they will correct and react upon
each other, and the people may hold the balance. If,
however, these powers coalesce, if the government can
corrupt the intellect, and if the intellect will yield
to the government, the inevitable result must be,
despotism in politics, and servility in literature. This
was the history of France under Louis XIV.: and this,
we may rest assured, will be the history of every
country that shall be tempted to follow so attractive
but so fatal an example.</p>

<p>The reputation of Louis XIV. originated in the
gratitude of men of letters; but it is now supported by
a popular notion that the celebrated literature of his
age is mainly to be ascribed to his fostering care. If,
however, we examine this opinion, we shall find that,
like many of the traditions of which history is full, it is
entirely devoid of truth. We shall find two leading
circumstances, which will prove that the literary
splendour of his reign was not the result of his efforts,
but was the work of that great generation which preceded
him; and that the intellect of France, so far from
being benefited by his munificence, was hampered by
his protection.</p>

<p>I. The first circumstance is, that the immense impulse
which, during the administrations of Richelieu
and of Mazarin, had been given to the highest branches
of knowledge, was suddenly stopped. In 1661 Louis
XIV. assumed the government;<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> and from that
moment until his death, in 1715, the history of France,
so far as great discoveries are concerned, is a blank in
the annals of Europe. If, putting aside all preconceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
notions respecting the supposed glory of that
age, we examine the matter fairly, it will be seen that
in every department there was a manifest dearth of
original thinkers. There was much that was elegant,
much that was attractive. The senses of men were
soothed and flattered by the creations of art, by paintings,
by palaces, by poems; but scarcely any thing of
moment was added to the sum of human knowledge.
If we take the mathematics, and those mixed sciences
to which they are applicable, it will be universally
admitted that their most successful cultivators in
France during the seventeenth century were Descartes,
Pascal, Fermat, Gassendi, and Mersenne. But, so far
from Louis XIV. having any share in the honour due
to them, these eminent men were engaged in their investigations
while the king was still in his cradle, and
completed them before he assumed the government,
and therefore before his system of protection came into
play. Descartes died in 1650,<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> when the king was
twelve years old. Pascal, whose name, like that of
Descartes, is commonly associated with the age of
Louis XIV., had gained an European reputation while
Louis, occupied in the nursery with his toys, was not
aware that any such man existed. His treatise on
conic sections was written in 1639;<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> his decisive experiments
on the weight of air were made in 1648;<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
and his researches on the cycloid, the last great
inquiry he ever undertook, were in 1658,<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Louis, still under the tutelage of Mazarin, had no sort
of authority. Fermat was one of the most profound
thinkers of the seventeenth century, particularly as a
geometrician, in which respect he was second only to
Descartes.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> The most important steps he took are
those concerning the geometry of infinites, applied to
the ordinates and tangents of curves; which, however,
he completed in or before 1636.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> As to Gassendi and
Mersenne, it is enough to say that Gassendi died in
1655,<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> six years before Louis was at the head of
affairs; while Mersenne died in 1648,<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> when the great
king was ten years old.</p>

<p>These were the men who flourished in France just
before the system of Louis XIV. came into operation.
Shortly after their death the patronage of the king
began to tell upon the national intellect; and during
the next fifty years no addition of importance was
made to either branch of the mathematics, or, with the
single exception of acoustics,<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> to any of the sciences to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
which the mathematics are applied.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> The further the
seventeenth century advanced, the more evident did
the decline become, and the more clearly can we trace
the connexion between the waning powers of the
French, and that protective spirit which enfeebled the
energies it wished to strengthen. Louis had heard
that astronomy is a noble study; he was therefore
anxious, by encouraging its cultivation in France,
to add to the glories of his own name.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> With
this view, he rewarded its professors with unexampled
profusion; he built the splendid Observatory of Paris;
he invited to his court the most eminent foreign astronomers,
Cassini from Italy, Römer from Denmark,
Huygens from Holland. But, as to native ability,
France did not produce a single man who made even
one of those various discoveries which mark the epochs
of astronomical science. In other countries vast progress
was made; and Newton in particular, by his
immense generalizations, reformed nearly every branch
of physics, and remodelled astronomy by carrying the
laws of gravitation to the extremity of the solar system.
On the other hand, France had fallen into such a torpor,
that these wonderful discoveries, which changed
the face of knowledge, were entirely neglected, there
being no instance of any French astronomer adopting
them until 1732, that is, forty-five years after they
had been published by their immortal author.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
in matters of detail, the most valuable improvement
made by French astronomers during the power of
Louis XIV. was not original. They laid claim to the
invention of the micrometer; an admirable resource,
which, as they supposed, was first contrived by Picard
and Auzout.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> The truth, however, is, that here again
they were anticipated by the activity of a freer and
less protected people; since the micrometer was invented
by Gascoigne in or just before 1639, when the
English monarch, so far from having leisure to patronize
science, was about to embark in that struggle which,
ten years later, cost him his crown and his life.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>The absence in France, during this period, not only
of great discoveries, but also of mere practical ingenuity,
is certainly very striking. In investigations
requiring minute accuracy, the necessary tools, if at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
complicated, were made by foreigners, the native workmen
being too unskilled to construct them; and Dr.
Lister, who was a very competent judge,<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> and who was
in Paris at the end of the seventeenth century, supplies
evidence that the best mathematical instruments sold
in that city were made, not by a Frenchman, but by
Butterfield, an Englishman residing there.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> Nor did
they succeed better in matters of immediate and obvious
utility. The improvements effected in manufactures
were few and insignificant, and were calculated, not
for the comfort of the people, but for the luxury of the
idle classes.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> What was really valuable was neglected;
no great invention was made; and by the end of the
reign of Louis XIV. scarcely anything had been done
in machinery, or in those other contrivances which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
by economising national labour, increase national
wealth.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>While such was the state, not only of mathematical
and astronomical science, but also of mechanical and
inventive arts, corresponding symptoms of declining
power were seen in other departments. In physiology,
in anatomy and in medicine, we look in vain for any
men equal to those by whom France had once been
honoured. The greatest discovery of this kind ever
made by a Frenchman, was that of the receptacle of
the chyle; a discovery which, in the opinion of a high
authority, is not inferior to that of the circulation of
the blood by Harvey.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> This important step in our
knowledge is constantly assigned to the age of Louis
XIV., as if it were one of the results of his gracious
bounty; but it would be difficult to tell what Louis
had to do with it, since the discovery was made by
Pecquet in 1647,<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> when the great king was nine years
old. After Pecquet, the most eminent of the French
anatomists in the seventeenth century was Riolan; and
his name we also find among the illustrious men who
adorned the reign of Louis XIV. But the principal
works of Riolan were written before Louis XIV. was
born; his last work was published in 1652; and he
himself died in 1657.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Then there came a pause, and,
during three generations, the French did nothing for
these great subjects: they wrote no work upon them
which is now read, they made no discoveries, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
seemed to have lost all heart, until that revival of
knowledge, which, as we shall presently see, took place
in France about the middle of the eighteenth century.
In the practical parts of medicine, in its speculative
parts, and in the arts connected with surgery, the same
law prevails. The French, in these, as in other matters,
had formerly produced men of great eminence, who
had won for themselves an European reputation, and
whose works are still remembered. Thus, only to
mention two or three instances, they had a long line of
illustrious physicians, among whom Fernel and Joubert
were the earliest;<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> they had, in surgery, Ambroise
Paré, who not only introduced important practical improvements,<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>
but who has the still rarer merit of being
one of the founders of comparative osteology;<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> and
they had Baillou, who late in the sixteenth and early in
the seventeenth century, advanced pathology, by connecting
it with the study of morbid anatomy.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Under
Louis XIV. all this was changed. Under him, surgery
was neglected, though in other countries its progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
was rapid.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> The English, by the middle of the seventeenth
century, had taken considerable steps in medicine:
its therapeutical branch being reformed chiefly
by Sydenham, its physiological branch by Glisson.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>
But the age of Louis XIV. cannot boast of a single
medical writer who can be compared to these; not even
one whose name is now known as having made any
specific addition to our knowledge. In Paris, the
practice of medicine was notoriously inferior to that in
the capitals of Germany, Italy, and England; while in
the French provinces, the ignorance, even of the best
physicians, was scandalous.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> Indeed, it is no exaggeration
to say that, during the whole of this long
period, the French in these matters effected comparatively
nothing; they made no contributions to clinical
literature,<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> and scarcely any to therapeutics, to pathology,
to physiology, or to anatomy.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>In what are called the natural sciences, we also find
the French now brought to a stand. In zoology, they
had formerly possessed remarkable men, among whom
Belon and Rondelet were the most conspicuous:<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> but,
under Louis XIV., they did not produce one original
observer in this great field of inquiry.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> In chemistry,
again, Rey had, in the reign of Louis XIII., struck out
views of such vast importance, that he anticipated some
of those generalizations which formed the glory of the
French intellect in the eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> During
the corrupt and frivolous age of Louis XIV., all this
was forgotten; the labours of Rey were neglected; and so
complete was the indifference, that even the celebrated
experiments of Boyle remained unknown in France for
more than forty years after they were published.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>Connected with zoology, and, to a philosophic mind,
inseparable from it, is botany: which, occupying a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
middle place between the animal and mineral world,
indicates their relation to each other, and at different
points touches the confines of both. It also throws
great light on the functions of nutrition,<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> and on the
laws of development; while, from the marked analogy
between animals and vegetables, we have every reason
to hope that its further progress, assisted by that of
electricity, will prepare the way for a comprehensive
theory of life, to which the resources of our knowledge
are still unequal, but towards which the movements of
modern science are manifestly tending. On these
grounds, far more than for the sake of practical advantages,
botany will always attract the attention of
thinking men; who, neglecting views of immediate
utility, look to large and ultimate results, and only
value particular facts in so far as they facilitate the
discovery of general truths. The first step in this
noble study was taken towards the middle of the sixteenth
century, when authors, instead of copying what
previous writers had said, began to observe nature for
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> The next step was, to add experiment to
observation: but it required another hundred years
before this could be done with accuracy; because the
microscope, which is essential to such inquiries, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
only invented about 1620, and the labour of a whole
generation was needed to make it available for minute
investigations.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> So soon, however, as this resource
was sufficiently matured to be applied to plants, the
march of botany became rapid, at least as far as details
are concerned; for it was not until the eighteenth
century that the facts were actually generalized. But,
in the preliminary work of accumulating the facts,
great energy was shown; and, for reasons stated in an
earlier part of the Introduction, this, like other studies
relating to the external world, advanced with peculiar
speed during the reign of Charles II. The tracheæ of
plants were discovered by Henshaw in 1661;<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> and
their cellular tissue by Hooke in 1667.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> These were
considerable approaches towards establishing the
analogy between plants and animals; and, within a few
years, Grew effected still more of the same kind. He
made such minute and extensive dissections, as to raise
the anatomy of vegetables to a separate study, and
prove that their organization is scarcely less complicated
than that possessed by animals.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> His first work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
was written in 1670;<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> and, in 1676, another Englishman,
Millington, ascertained the existence of a distinction
of sexes;<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> thus supplying further evidence of
the harmony between the animal and vegetable kingdoms,
and of the unity of idea which regulates their
composition.</p>

<p>This is what was effected in England during the
reign of Charles II.; and we now ask what was done
in France, during the same period, under the munificent
patronage of Louis XIV. The answer is, nothing; no
discovery, no idea, which forms an epoch in this important
department of natural science. The son of the
celebrated Sir Thomas Brown visited Paris in the hope
of making some additions to his knowledge of botany,
which he thought he could not fail to do in a country
where science was held in such honour, its professors so
caressed by the court, and its researches so bountifully
encouraged. To his surprise, he, in 1665, found in that
great city no one capable of teaching his favourite pursuit,
and even the public lectures on it miserably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
meagre and unsatisfactory.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> Neither then, nor at a
much later period, did the French possess a good popular
treatise on botany: still less did they make any
improvement in it. Indeed, so completely was the philosophy
of the subject misunderstood, that Tournefort,
the only French botanist of repute in the reign of Louis,
actually rejected that discovery of the sexes of plants,
which had been made before he began to write, and
which afterwards became the corner-stone of the Linnæan
system.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> This showed his incapacity for those
large views respecting the unity of the organic world,
which alone give to botany a scientific value; and we
find, accordingly, that he did nothing for the physiology
of plants, and that his only merit was as a collector and
classifier of them.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> And even in his classification he
was guided, not by a comprehensive comparison of their
various parts, but by considerations drawn from the
mere appearance of the flower:<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> thus depriving botany
of its real grandeur, degrading it into an arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of beautiful objects, and supplying another instance of
the way in which the Frenchmen of that generation
impoverished what they sought to enrich, and dwarfed
every topic, until they suited the intellect and pleased
the eye of that ignorant and luxurious court, to whose
favour they looked for reward, and whose applause it
was the business of their life to gain.</p>

<p>The truth is, that in these, as in all matters of real
importance, in questions requiring independent thought,
and in questions of practical utility, the age of
Louis XIV. was an age of decay: it was an age of
misery, of intolerance, and oppression; it was an age of
bondage, of ignominy, of incompetence. This would
long since have been universally admitted, if those who
have written the history of that period had taken the
trouble to study subjects without which no history can
be understood; or, I should rather say, without which
no history can exist. If this had been done, the reputation
of Louis XIV. would at once have shrunk to its
natural size. Even at the risk of exposing myself to
the charge of unduly estimating my own labours, I
cannot avoid saying, that the facts which I have just
pointed out have never before been collected, but have
remained isolated in the text-books and repertories of
the sciences to which they belong. Yet without them
it is impossible to study the age of Louis XIV. It is
impossible to estimate the character of any period
except by tracing its development; in other words, by
measuring the extent of its knowledge. Therefore it
is, that to write the history of a country without regard
to its intellectual progress, is as if an astronomer
should compose a planetary system without regard to
the sun, by whose light alone the planets can be seen,
and by whose attraction they are held in their course,
and compelled to run in the path of their appointed
orbits. For the great luminary, even as it shines in the
heaven, is not a more noble or a more powerful object
than is the intellect of man in this nether world. It is
to the human intellect, and to that alone, that every
country owes its knowledge. And what is it but the
progress and diffusion of knowledge which has given us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
our arts, our sciences, our manufactures, our laws, our
opinions, our manners, our comforts, our luxuries, our
civilization; in short, everything that raises us above
the savages, who by their ignorance are degraded to
the level of the brutes with which they herd? Surely,
then, the time has now arrived when they who undertake
to write the history of a great nation should
occupy themselves with those matters by which alone
the destiny of men is regulated, and should abandon
the petty and insignificant details by which we have
too long been wearied; details respecting the lives of
kings, the intrigues of ministers, the vices and the
gossip of courts.</p>

<p>It is precisely these higher considerations which furnish
the key to the history of the reign of Louis XIV.
In that time, as in all others, the misery of the people
and the degradation of the country followed the decline
of the national intellect; while this last was, in its
turn, the result of the protective spirit&mdash;that mischievous
spirit which weakens whatever it touches. If
in the long course and compass of history there is one
thing more clear than another, it is, that whenever a
government undertakes to protect intellectual pursuits,
it will almost always protect them in the wrong place,
and reward the wrong men. Nor is it surprising that
this should be the case. What can kings and ministers
know about those immense branches of knowledge, to
cultivate which with success is often the business of an
entire life? How can they, constantly occupied with
their lofty pursuits, have leisure for such inferior
matters? Is it to be supposed that such acquirements
will be found among statesmen, who are always engaged
in the most weighty concerns; sometimes writing despatches,
sometimes making speeches, sometimes organising
a party in the parliament, sometimes baffling an
intrigue in the privy-chamber? Or if the sovereign
should graciously bestow his patronage according to
his own judgment, are we to expect that mere philosophy
and science should be familiar to high and
mighty princes, who have their own peculiar and
arduous studies, and who have to learn the mysteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of heraldry, the nature and dignities of rank, the comparative
value of the different orders, decorations, and
titles, the laws of precedence, the prerogatives of noble
birth, the names and powers of ribbons, stars, and
garters, the various modes of conferring an honour or
installing into an office, the adjustment of ceremonies,
the subtleties of etiquette, and all those other courtly
accomplishments necessary to the exalted functions
which they perform?</p>

<p>The mere statement of such questions proves the
absurdity of the principle which they involve. For,
unless we believe that kings are omniscient as well as
immaculate, it is evident that in the bestowal of rewards
they must be guided either by personal caprice or by
the testimony of competent judges. And since no one
is a competent judge of scientific excellence unless he
is himself scientific, we are driven to this monstrous
alternative, that the rewards of intellectual labour
must be conferred injudiciously, or else that they must
be given according to the verdict of that very class by
whom they are received. In the first case, the reward
will be ridiculous; in the latter case, it will be disgraceful.
In the former case, weak men will be benefited
by wealth which is taken from industry to be
lavished on idleness. But in the latter case, those men
of real genius, those great and illustrious thinkers, who
are the masters and teachers of the human race, are to
be tricked out with trumpery titles; and after scrambling
in miserable rivalry for the sordid favours of a
court, they are then to be turned into beggars of the
state, who not only clamour for their share of the spoil,
but even regulate the proportions into which the shares
are to be divided.</p>

<p>Under such a system, the natural results are, first,
the impoverishment and servility of genius: then the
decay of knowledge; then the decline of the country.
Three times in the history of the world has this experiment
been tried. In the ages of Augustus, of Leo X.,
and of Louis XIV., the same method was adopted, and
the same result ensued. In each of these ages, there was
much apparent splendour, immediately succeeded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
sudden ruin. In each instance, the brilliancy survived
the independence; and in each instance, the national
spirit sank under that pernicious alliance between
government and literature, by virtue of which the political
classes become very powerful, and the intellectual
classes very weak, simply because they who dispense
the patronage will, of course, receive the homage; and
if, on the one hand, government is always ready to
reward literature, so on the other hand, will literature
be always ready to succumb to government.</p>

<p>Of these three ages, that of Louis XIV. was incomparably
the worst; and nothing but the amazing
energy of the French people could have enabled them
to rally, as they afterwards did, from the effects of so
enfeebling a system. But though they rallied, the
effort cost them dear. The struggle, as we shall presently
see, lasted two generations, and was only ended
by that frightful Revolution which formed its natural
climax. What the real history of that struggle was, I
shall endeavour to ascertain towards the conclusion of
this volume. Without, however, anticipating the course
of affairs, we will now proceed to what I have already
mentioned as the second great characteristic of the
reign of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>II. The second intellectual characteristic of the reign
of Louis XIV. is, in importance, hardly inferior to the
first. We have already seen that the national intellect,
stunted by the protection of the court, was so diverted
from the noblest branches of knowledge, that in none of
them did it produce anything worthy of being recorded.
As a natural consequence, the minds of men, driven
from the higher departments, took refuge in the lower,
and concentrated themselves upon those inferior subjects,
where the discovery of truth is not the main
object, but where beauty of form and expression are the
things chiefly pursued. Thus, the first consequence of
the patronage of Louis XIV. was, to diminish the field for
genius, and to sacrifice science to art. The second consequence
was, that, even in art itself, there was soon
seen a marked decay. For a short time, the stimulus
produced its effect; but was followed by that collapse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
which is its natural result. So essentially vicious is the
whole system of patronage and reward, that after the
death of those writers and artists, whose works form
the only redeeming point in the reign of Louis, there
was found no one capable of even imitating their excellences.
The poets, dramatists, painters, musicians,
sculptors, architects, were, with hardly an exception,
not only born, but educated under that freer policy,
which existed before his time. When they began their
labours, they benefited by a munificence which encouraged
the activity of their genius. But in a few years,
that generation having died off, the hollowness of the
whole system was clearly exposed. More than a quarter
of a century before the death of Louis XIV., most
of these eminent men had ceased to live; and then it
was seen to how miserable a plight the country was reduced
under the boasted patronage of the great king.
At the moment when Louis XIV. died, there was
scarcely a writer or an artist in France who enjoyed an
European reputation. This is a circumstance well worth
our notice. If we compare the different classes of literature,
we shall find that sacred oratory, being the least
influenced by the king, was able the longest to bear up
against his system. Massillon belongs partly to the
subsequent reign; but even of the other great divines,
Bossuet and Bourdaloue both lived to 1704,<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> Mascaron
to 1703,<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> and Flechier to 1710.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> As, however, the
king, particularly in his latter years, was very fearful
of meddling with the church, it is in profane matters
that we can best trace the workings of his policy, because
it is there that his interference was most active.
With a view to this, the simplest plan will be, to look,
in the first place, into the history of the fine arts; and
after ascertaining who the greatest artists were, observe
the year in which they died, remembering that the government
of Louis XIV. began in 1661, and ended in
1715.</p>

<p>If, now, we examine this period of fifty-four years, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
shall be struck by the remarkable fact, that everything
which is celebrated was effected in the first half of it;
while more than twenty years before its close, the most
eminent masters all died without leaving any successors.
The six greatest painters in the reign of Louis XIV.
were Poussin, Lesueur, Claude Lorraine, Le Brun, and
the two Mignards. Of these, Le Brun died in 1690;<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>
the elder Mignard in 1668;<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> the younger in 1695;<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
Claude Lorraine in 1682;<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> Lesueur in 1655;<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> and
Poussin, perhaps the most distinguished of all the
French school, died in 1665.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> The two greatest architects
were, Claude Perrault and Francis Mansart; but
Perrault died in 1688;<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> Mansart in 1666;<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> and Blondel,
the next in fame, died in 1686.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> The greatest of all
the sculptors was Puget, who died in 1694.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> Lulli, the
founder of French music, died in 1687.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> Quinault, the
greatest poet of French music, died in 1688.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> Under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
these eminent men, the fine arts, in the reign of Louis
XIV., reached their zenith; and during the last thirty
years of his life, their decline was portentously rapid.
This was the case, not only in architecture and music,
but even in painting, which, being more subservient
than they are to personal vanity, is more likely to
flourish under a rich and despotic government. The
genius, however, of painters fell so low, that long before
the death of Louis XIV., France ceased to possess one
of any merit; and when his successor came to the
throne, this beautiful art was, in that great country,
almost extinct.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p>These are startling facts; not matters of opinion,
which may be disputed, but stubborn dates, supported
by irrefragable testimony. And if we examine in the
same manner the literature of the age of Louis XIV.,
we shall arrive at similar conclusions. If we ascertain
the dates of those masterpieces which adorn his reign,
we shall find that during the last five-and-twenty years
of his life, when his patronage had been the longest in
operation, it was entirely barren of results; in other
words, that when the French had been most habituated
to his protection, they were least able to effect great
things. Louis XIV. died in 1715. Racine produced
<i>Phedre</i> in 1677; <i>Andromaque</i> in 1667; <i>Athelie</i> in 1691.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>
Molière published the <i>Misanthrope</i> in 1666; <i>Tartuffe</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
in 1667; the <i>Avare</i> in 1668.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> The <i>Lutrin</i> of Boileau

of the age of Louis XIV. The authors of these
immortal works all ceased to write, and nearly all ceased
to live, before the close of the seventeenth century; and
we may fairly ask the admirers of Louis XIV. who
those men were that succeeded them. Where have
their names been registered? Where are their works to
be found? Who is there that now reads the books of
those obscure hirelings, who for so many years thronged
the court of the great king? Who has heard anything
of Campistron, La Chapelle, Genest, Ducerceau,
Dancourt, Danchet, Vergier, Catrou, Chaulieu, Legendre,
Valincour, Lamotte, and the other ignoble compilers,
who long remained the brightest ornaments of
France? Was this, then, the consequence of the royal
bounty? Was this the fruit of the royal patronage?
If the system of reward and protection is really advantageous
to literature and to art, how is it that it should
have produced the meanest results when it had been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
longest in operation? If the favour of kings is, as their
flatterers tell us, of such importance, how comes it that
the more the favour was displayed, the more the effects
were contemptible?</p>

<p>Nor was this almost inconceivable penury compensated
by superiority in any other department. The simple
fact is that Louis XIV. survived the entire intellect of
the French nation, except that small part of it which
grew up in opposition to his principles, and afterwards
shook the throne of his successor.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> Several years before
his death, and when his protective system had been
in full force for nearly half a century, there was not to
be found in the whole of France a statesman who could
develop the resources of the country, or a general who
could defend it against its enemies. Both in the civil
service and in the military service, every thing had fallen
into disorder. At home there was nothing but confusion;
abroad there was nothing but disaster. The
spirit of France succumbed, and was laid prostrate.
The men of letters, pensioned and decorated by the
court, had degenerated into a fawning and hypocritical
race, who, to meet the wishes of their masters, opposed
all improvement, and exerted themselves in support of
every old abuse. The end of all this was, a corruption,
a servility, and a loss of power more complete than has
ever been witnessed in any of the great countries of
Europe. There was no popular liberty; there were no
great men; there was no science; there was no literature;
there were no arts. Within, there was a discontented
people, a rapacious government, and a beggared exchequer.
Without, there were foreign armies, which
pressed upon all the frontiers, and which nothing but
their mutual jealousies, and a change in the English
cabinet, prevented from dismembering the monarchy of
France.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the forlorn position of that noble country
towards the close of the reign of Louis XIV.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
misfortunes which embittered the declining years of the
king were, indeed, so serious, that they could not fail
to excite our sympathy, if we did not know that they
were the result of his own turbulent ambition, of his
insufferable arrogance, but, above all, of a grasping and
restless vanity, which, making him eager to concentrate
on his single person all the glory of France, gave rise
to that insidious policy, which, with gifts, with honours,
and with honied words, began by gaining the admiration
of the intellectual classes, then made them courtly and
time-serving, and ended by destroying all their boldness,
stifling every effort of original thought, and thus postponing
for an indefinite period the progress of national
civilization.</p>

letters, see <i>Capefigue's Louis XIV.</i>, vol. i. pp. 41, 42, 116; and on

general, and still more, at the willing servility. Lord Shaftesbury, in
a letter dated February 1704&ndash;5, passes a glowing eulogy upon liberty;
but he adds, that in France &lsquo;you will hardly find this argument
understood; for whatever flashes may now and then appear, I never yet
knew one single Frenchman a free man.&rsquo; <i>Forster's Original Letters of
Locke, Sidney, and Shaftesbury</i>, 1830, p. 205. In the same year, De Foe
makes a similar remark in regard to the French nobles, <i>Wilson's Life of
De Foe</i>, vol. ii. p. 209; and, in 1699, Addison writes from Blois a
letter which strikingly illustrates the degradation of the French.

<i>Siècle de Louis XIV</i>, in <i>&#338;uvres de Voltaire</i>, vol. xx. pp.
377, 378. Voltaire says that the Protestants who persisted in their
religion &lsquo;étaient livrés aux soldats, qui eurent toute licence, excepté
celle de tuer. Il y eut pourtant plusieurs personnes si cruellement
maltraitées qu'elles en moururent.&rsquo; And Burnet, who was in France in
1685, says, &lsquo;all men set their thoughts on work to invent new methods of
cruelty.&rsquo; What some of those methods were, I shall now relate; because
the evidence, however painful it may be, is necessary to enable us to
understand the reign of Louis XIV. It is necessary that the veil should
be rent; and that the squeamish delicacy which would hide such facts,
should give way before the obligation which the historian is under of
holding up to public opprobrium, and branding with public infamy, the
church by which the measures were instigated, the sovereign by whom they
were enforced, and the age in which they were permitted.</p>

<p>The two original sources for our knowledge of these events are, <i>Quick's
Synodicon in Gallia</i>, 1692, folio; and <i>Benoist</i>, <i>Histoire de l'Edit de
Nantes</i>, 1695, 4to. From these works I extract the following accounts of
what happened in France in 1685. &lsquo;Afterwards they fall upon the persons
of the Protestants; and there was no wickedness, though never so horrid,
which they did not put in practice, that they might enforce them to
change their religion&hellip;. They bound them as criminals are when they be
put to the rack; and in that posture, putting a funnel into their
mouths, they poured wine down their throats till its fumes had deprived
them of their reason, and they had in that condition made them consent
to become Catholics. Some they stripped stark naked, and after they had
offered them a thousand indignities, they stuck them with pins from head
to foot; they cut them with pen-knives, tear them by the noses with
red-hot pincers, and dragged them about the rooms till they promised to
become Roman Catholics, or that the doleful outcries of these poor
tormented creatures, calling upon God for mercy, constrained them to let
them go&hellip;. In some places they tied fathers and husbands to the
bed-posts, and ravished their wives and daughters before their eyes&hellip;.
From others they pluck off the nails of their hands and toes, which must
needs cause an intolerable pain. They burnt the feet of others. They
blew up men and women with bellows, till they were ready to burst in
pieces. If these horrid usages could not prevail upon them to violate
their consciences, and abandon their religion, they did then imprison
them in close and noisome dungeons, in which they exercised all kinds of
inhumanities upon them.&rsquo; <i>Quick's Synodicon</i>, vol. i. pp. cxxx.
cxxxi. &lsquo;Cependant les troupes exerçoient partout de cruautez inouies.
Tout leur étoit permis, pourveu qu'ils ne fissent pas mourir. Ils
faisoient danser quelquefois leurs hôtes, jusqu'à ce qu'ils tombassent
en défaillance. Ils bernoient les autres jusqu'à ce qu'ils n'en
pouvoient plus&hellip;. Il y en eut quelques-uns à qui on versa de l'eau
bouillante dans la bouche&hellip;. Il y en eut plusieurs à qui on donna des
coups de bâton sous les pieds, pour éprouver si ce supplice est aussi
cruel que les relations le publient. On arrachoit à d'autres le poil de
la barbe&hellip;. D'autres brûloient à la chandelle le poil des bras et des
jambes de leurs hôtes. D'autres faisoient brûler de la poudre, si près
du visage de ceux qui leur resistoient, qu'elle leur grilloit toute la
peau. Ils mettoient à d'autres des charbons allumez dans les mains, et
les contraignoient de les tenir fermées, jusqu'à ce que les charbons
fussent éteints&hellip;. On brûla les pieds à plusieurs, tenant les uns
long-tems devant un grand feu; appliquant aux autres une pelle ardente
sous les pieds; liant les pieds des autres dans des bottines pleines de
graisse, qu'on faisoit fondre et chauffer peu à peu devant un brasier
ardent.&rsquo; <i>Benoist</i>, <i>Hist. de l'Edit de Nantes</i>, vol. v. pp.
887&ndash;889. One of the Protestants, named Ryau, they &lsquo;lièrent fort
étroitement; lui sevrèrent les doigts des mains; lui fichèrent des
épingles sous les ongles; lui firent brûler de la poudre dans les
oreilles; lui percèrent les cuisses en plusieurs lieux, et versèrent du
vinaigre et du sel dans ses blessures. <i>Par ce tourment ils épuisèrent
sa patience en deux jours; et le forcèrent à changer de religion</i>,&rsquo; p.
890. &lsquo;Ses dragons étoient les mêmes en tous lieux. Ils battoient, ils
étourdissoient, ils brûloient en Bourgogne comme en Poitou, en Champagne
comme en Guyenne, en Normandie comme en Languedoc. Mais ils n'avoient
pour les femmes ni plus de respect, ni plus de pitié que pour les
hommes. Au contraire, ils abusoient de la tendre pudeur qui est une des
propriétez de leur sexe; et ils s'en prevaloient pour leur faire de plus
sensibles outrages. On leur levoit quelquefois leurs juppes par dessus
la tête, et on leur jetoit des seaux d'eau sur le corps. Il y en eut
plusieurs que les soldats mirent en chemise, et qu'ils forcèrent de
danser avec eux dans cet état&hellip;. Deux filles de Calais, nommées le
Noble, furent mises toutes nuës sur le pavé, et furent ainsi exposées à
la mocquerie et aux outrages des passans&hellip;. Des dragons ayant lié la
dame de Vezençai à la quenouille de son lit, lui crachoient
dans la bouche quand elle l'ouvroit pour parler ou pour soupirer.&rsquo; pp.
891, 892. At p. 917 are other details, far more horrible, respecting the
treatment of women, and which indignation rather than shame prevents me
from transcribing. Indeed, the shame can only light on the church and
the government under whose united authority such scandalous outrages
could be openly perpetrated, merely for the sake of compelling men to
change their religious opinions.</p></div>

&ldquo;<i>Majesty</i>.&rdquo; They are termed &ldquo;<i>The Lord's anointed</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>The Vicegerent

or blasphemous, but which are outdone in absurdity by the kings of the

175, 176. All this is the more remarkable, because several of the
conclusions at which Newton had arrived were divulged before they were
embodied in the <i>Principia</i>; and it appears from <i>Brewster's Life of
Newton</i> (vol. i. pp. 25, 26, 290), that his speculations concerning
gravity began in 1666, or perhaps in the autumn of 1665.</p></div>

it in 1639, or possibly a year or two earlier. Compare <i>Humboldt's

erroneously dates it in 1640. Montucla (<i>Hist. des Mathémat.</i> vol. ii.

Maintenon</i> (vol. i. pp. 263, 284, 358, 389, 393, 408, 414, 422, 426,
447, 457, 463, vol. ii. pp. 19, 23, 33, 46, 56, and numerous other
passages) fully confirm this, and, moreover, prove that in Paris, early
in the eighteenth century, the resources, even of the wealthy classes,
were beginning to fail; while both public and private credit were so
shaken, that it was hardly possible to obtain money on any terms. In
1710, she, the wife of Louis XIV., complains of her inability to borrow
500 livres: &lsquo;Tout mon crédit échoue souvent auprès de M. Desmaretz pour
une somme de cinq cents livres.&rsquo; <i>Ibid.</i> vol. ii. p. 33. In 1709, she
writes (vol. i. p. 447): &lsquo;Le jeu devient insipide, parce qu'il n'y a
presque plus d'argent.&rsquo; See also vol. ii. p. 112; and in February 1711
(p. 151): &lsquo;Ce n'est pas l'abondance mais l'avarice qui fait jouer nos
courtisans; on met le tout pour le tout pour avoir quelque argent, et
les tables de lansquenet ont plus l'air d'un triste commerce que d'un
divertissement.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In regard to the people generally, the French writers supply us with
little information, because in that age they were too much occupied with
their great king and their showy literature, to pay attention to mere
popular interests. But I have collected from other sources some
information which I will now put together, and which I recommend to the
notice of the next French author who undertakes to compose a history of
Louis XIV.</p>

<p>Locke, who was travelling in France in 1676 and 1677,
writes in his journal, &lsquo;The rent of land in France fallen one&ndash;half in
these few years, by reason of the poverty of the people.&rsquo; <i>King's Life
of Locke</i>, vol. i. p. 139. About the same time, Sir William Temple says
(<i>Works</i>, vol. ii. p. 268), &lsquo;The French peasantry are wholly dispirited
by labour and want.&rsquo; In 1691, another observer, proceeding from Calais,
writes, &lsquo;From hence, travelling to Paris, there was opportunity enough
to observe what a prodigious state of poverty the ambition and
absoluteness of a tyrant can reduce an opulent and fertile country to.
There were visible all the marks and signs of a growing misfortune; all
the dismal indications of an overwhelming calamity. The fields were
uncultivated, the villages unpeopled, the houses dropping to decay.&rsquo;
<i>Burton's Diary</i>, note by Rutt, vol. iv. p. 79. In a tract published in
1689, the author says (<i>Somers Tracts</i>, vol. x. p. 264), &lsquo;I have known
in France poor people sell their beds, and lie upon straw; sell their
pots, kettles, and all their necessary household goods, to content the
unmerciful collectors of the king's taxes.&rsquo; Dr. Lister, who visited
Paris in 1698, says, &lsquo;Such is the vast multitude of poor wretches in all
parts of this city, that whether a person is in a carriage or on foot,
in the street, or even in a shop, he is alike unable to transact
business, on account of the importunities of mendicants.&rsquo; <i>Lister's
Account of Paris</i>, p. 46. Compare a <i>Letter from Prior</i>, in <i>Ellis's
Letters of Literary Men</i>, p. 213. In 1708, Addison, who, from personal
observation, was well acquainted with France, writes: &lsquo;We think here as
you do in the country, that France is on her last legs.&rsquo; <i>Aikin's Life
of Addison</i>, vol. i. p. 233. Finally, in 1718&mdash;that is, three years
after the death of Louis&mdash;Lady Mary Montagu
gives the following account of the result of his reign, in a letter to
Lady Rich, dated Paris, 10th October, 1718: &lsquo;I think nothing so terrible
as objects of misery, except one had the god-like attribute of being
able to redress them; and all the country villages of France show
nothing else. While the post-horses are changed, the whole town comes
out to beg, with such miserable starved faces, and thin, tattered
clothes, they need no other eloquence to persuade one of the
wretchedness of their condition.&rsquo; <i>Works of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu</i>,

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">DEATH OF LOUIS XIV. REACTION AGAINST THE PROTECTIVE SPIRIT,
AND PREPARATIONS FOR THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.</div>

<p>At length Louis XIV. died. When it was positively
known that the old king had ceased to breathe, the
people went almost mad with joy.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> The tyranny which
had weighed them down was removed; and there at
once followed a reaction which, for sudden violence,
has no parallel in modern history.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> The great majority
indemnified themselves for their forced hypocrisy by
indulging in the grossest licentiousness. But among
the generation then forming, there were some high-spirited
youths, who had far higher views, and whose
notions of liberty were not confined to the license of the
gaming-house and the brothel. Devoted to the great
idea of restoring to France that freedom of utterance
which it had lost, they naturally turned their eyes
towards the only country where the freedom was
practised. Their determination to search for liberty
in the place where alone it could be found, gave rise to
that junction of the French and English intellects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
which, looking at the immense chain of its effects, is
by far the most important fact in the history of the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>During the reign of Louis XIV., the French, puffed
up by national vanity, despised the barbarism of a
people who were so uncivilized as to be always turning
on their rulers, and who, within the space of forty
years, had executed one king, and deposed another.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>
They could not believe that such a restless horde possessed
anything worthy the attention of enlightened
men. Our laws, our literature, and our manners, were
perfectly unknown to them; and I doubt if at the end
of the seventeenth century there were, either in literature
or in science, five persons in France acquainted
with the English language.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> But a long experience of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the reign of Louis XIV. induced the French to reconsider
many of their opinions. It induced them to suspect
that despotism may have its disadvantages, and that a
government composed of princes and bishops is not
necessarily the best for a civilized country. They began
to look, first with complacency, and then with respect,
upon that strange and outlandish people, who, though
only separated from themselves by a narrow sea, appeared
to be of an altogether different kind; and who,
having punished their oppressors, had carried their
liberties and their prosperity to a height of which the
world had seen no example. These feelings, which
before the Revolution broke out, were entertained by
the whole of the educated classes in France, were in
the beginning, confined to those men whose intellects
placed them at the head of their age. During the two
generations which elapsed between the death of Louis
XIV. and the outbreak of the Revolution, there was
hardly a Frenchman of eminence who did not either
visit England or learn English; while many of them
did both. Buffon, Brissot, Broussonnet, Condamine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Delisle, Elie de Beaumont, Gournay, Helvétius, Jussieu,
Lalande, Lafayette, Larcher, L'Héritier, Montesquieu,
Maupertuis, Morellet, Mirabeau, Nollet, Raynal, the
celebrated Roland, and his still more celebrated wife,
Rousseau, Ségur, Suard, Voltaire&mdash;all these remarkable
persons flocked to London, as also did others of inferior
ability, but of considerable influence, such as Brequiny,
Bordes, Calonne, Coyer, Cormatin, Dufay, Dumarest,
Dezallier, Favier, Girod, Grosley, Godin, D'Hancarville,
Hunauld, Jars, Le Blanc, Ledru, Lescallier, Linguet,
Lesuire, Lemonnier, Levesque de Pouilly, Montgolfier,
Morand, Patu, Poissonier, Reveillon, Septchènes,
Silhouette, Siret, Soulavie, Soulès, and Valmont de
Brienne.</p>

<p>Nearly all of these carefully studied our language,
and most of them seized the spirit of our literature.
Voltaire, in particular, devoted himself with his usual
ardour to the new pursuit, and acquired in England a
knowledge of those doctrines, the promulgation of
which, afterwards won for him so great a reputation.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
He was the first who popularized in France the philosophy
of Newton, where it rapidly superseded that of
Descartes.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> He recommended to his countrymen the
writings of Locke;<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> which soon gained immense popularity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and which supplied materials to Condillac for
his system of metaphysics,<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> and to Rousseau for his
theory of education.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> Besides this, Voltaire was the
first Frenchman who studied Shakespeare; to whose
works he was greatly indebted, though he afterwards
wished to lessen what he considered the exorbitant
respect paid to them in France.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> Indeed, so intimate
was his knowledge of the English language,<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> that we
can trace his obligations to Butler,<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> one of the most
difficult of our poets, and to Tillotson,<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> one of the
dullest of our theologians. He was acquainted with
the speculations of Berkeley,<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> the most subtle metaphysician
who has ever written in English; and he had
read the works, not only of Shaftesbury,<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> but even of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Chubb,<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> Garth,<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> Mandeville,<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> and Woolston.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> Montesquieu
imbibed in our country many of his principles;
he studied our language; and he always expressed admiration
for England, not only in his writings, but also
in his private conversation.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> Buffon learnt English,
and his first appearance as an author was as the translator
of Newton and of Hales.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Diderot, following in
the same course, was an enthusiastic admirer of the
novels of Richardson;<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> he took the idea of several of
his plays from the English dramatists, particularly from
Lillo; he borrowed many of his arguments from Shaftesbury
and Collins, and his earliest publication was a
translation of Stanyan's <i>History of Greece</i>.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> Helvétius,
who visited London, was never weary of praising the
people; many of the views in his great work on the
Mind are drawn from Mandeville; and he constantly
refers to the authority of Locke, whose principles hardly
any Frenchman would at an earlier period have dared
to recommend.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> The works of Bacon, previously little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
known, were now translated into French; and his classification
of the human faculties was made the basis of
that celebrated Encyclopædia, which is justly regarded
as one of the greatest productions of the eighteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> The <i>Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>, by Adam
Smith, was during thirty-four years translated three
different times, by three different French authors.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>
And such was the general eagerness, that directly the
<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, by the same great writer, appeared,
Morellet, who was then high in reputation, began to
turn it into French; and was only prevented from
printing his translation by the circumstance, that before
it could be completed, another version of it was published
in a French periodical.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> Coyer, who is still
remembered for his <i>Life of Sobieski</i>, visited England;
and after returning to his own country, showed the
direction of his studies by rendering into French the
Commentaries of Blackstone.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> Le Blanc travelled in
England, wrote a work expressly upon the English, and
translated into French the Political Discourses of
Hume.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> Holbach was certainly one of the most
active leaders of the liberal party in Paris; but a large
part of his very numerous writings consists solely in
translations of English authors.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> Indeed, it may be
broadly stated, that while, at the end of the seventeenth
century, it would have been difficult to find, even
among the most educated Frenchmen, a single person
acquainted with English, it would, in the eighteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
century, have been nearly as difficult to find in the
same class one who was ignorant of it. Men of all
tastes, and of the most opposite pursuits, were on this

Indeed, Le Blanc, who wrote shortly before the middle
of the eighteenth century, says: &lsquo;We have placed English
in the rank of the learned languages; our women
study it, and have abandoned Italian in order to study
the language of this philosophic people; nor is there
to be found among us any one who does not desire to
learn it.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p>

<p>Such was the eagerness with which the French imbibed
the literature of a people whom but a few years
before they had heartily despised. The truth is, that
in this new state of things they had no alternative.
For where but in England was a literature to be found
that could satisfy those bold and inquisitive thinkers
who arose in France after the death of Louis XIV.?
In their own country there had no doubt been great
displays of eloquence, of fine dramas, and of poetry,
which, though never reaching the highest point of excellence,
is of finished and admirable beauty. But it is
an unquestionable fact, and one melancholy to contemplate,
that during the sixty years which succeeded the
death of Descartes, France had not possessed a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
man who dared to think for himself. Metaphysicians,
moralists, historians, all had become tainted by the
servility of that bad age. During two generations, no
Frenchman had been allowed to discuss with freedom
any question, either of politics or of religion. The consequence
was, that the largest intellects, excluded from
their legitimate field, lost their energy; the national
spirit died away; the very materials and nutriment of
thought seemed to be wanting. No wonder then, if the
great Frenchmen of the eighteenth century sought that
aliment abroad which they were unable to find at home.
No wonder if they turned from their own land, and
gazed with admiration at the only people who, pushing
their inquiries into the highest departments, had shown
the same fearlessness in politics as in religion; a people
who, having punished their kings and controlled their
clergy, were storing the treasures of their experience in
that noble literature which never can perish, and of
which it may be said in sober truth, that it has stimulated
the intellect of the most distant races, and that,
planted in America and in India, it has already fertilized
the two extremities of the world.</p>

<p>There are, in fact, few things in history so instructive
as the extent to which France was influenced by this
new pursuit. Even those who took part in actually
consummating the Revolution, were moved by the prevailing
spirit. The English language was familiar to

curiosity, came to our country; and, as if to show that
persons of every shade and of every rank were actuated
by the same spirit, the Duke of Orleans likewise visited
England; nor did his visit fail to produce its natural
results. &lsquo;It was,&rsquo; says a celebrated writer, &lsquo;in the
society of London that he acquired a taste for liberty;
and it was on his return from there that he brought into
France a love of popular agitation, a contempt for his
own rank, and a familiarity with those beneath him.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>

<p>This language, strong as it is, will not appear exaggerated
to any one who has carefully studied the history
of the eighteenth century. It is no doubt certain, that
the French Revolution was essentially a reaction against
that protective and interfering spirit which reached its
zenith under Louis XIV., but which, centuries before
his reign, had exercised a most injurious influence over
the national prosperity. While, however, this must be
fully conceded, it is equally certain that the impetus to
which the reaction owed its strength, proceeded from
England; and that it was English literature which
taught the lessons of political liberty, first to France,
and through France to the rest of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> On this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
account, and not at all from mere literary curiosity, I
have traced with some minuteness that union between
the French and English minds, which, though often
noticed, has never been examined with the care its importance
deserves. The circumstances which reinforced
this vast movement will be related towards the end of
the volume; at present I will confine myself to its first
great consequence, namely, the establishment of a complete
schism between the literary men of France, and
the classes who exclusively governed the country.</p>

<p>Those eminent Frenchmen who now turned their
attention to England, found in its literature, in the
structure of its society, and in its government, many
peculiarities of which their own country furnished no
example. They heard political and religious questions
of the greatest moment debated with a boldness unknown
in any other part of Europe. They heard
dissenters and churchmen, whigs and tories, handling
the most dangerous topics, and treating them with
unlimited freedom. They heard public disputes
respecting matters which no one in France dared to
discuss; mysteries of state and mysteries of creed
unfolded and rudely exposed to the popular gaze. And,
what to Frenchmen of that age must have been equally
amazing, they not only found a public press possessing
some degree of freedom, but they found that within the
very walls of parliament the administration of the crown
was assailed with complete impunity, the character of its
chosen servants constantly aspersed, and, strange to say,
even the management of its revenues effectually controlled.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></p>

<p>The successors of the age of Louis XIV., seeing these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
things, and seeing, moreover, that the civilization of the
country increased as the authority of the upper classes
and of the crown diminished, were unable to restrain
their wonder at so novel and exciting a spectacle. &lsquo;The
English nation,&rsquo; says Voltaire, &lsquo;is the only one on
the earth, which, by resisting its kings, has succeeded
in lessening their power.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> How I love the boldness

think!&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> The English, says Le Blanc, are willing to

more freedom than any republic;<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> and their system is
in fact a republic disguised as a monarchy.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> Grosley,
struck with amazement, exclaims, &lsquo;Property is in England
a thing sacred, which the laws protect from all
encroachment, not only from engineers, inspectors, and
other people of that stamp, but even from the king
himself.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> Mably, in the most celebrated of all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
works, says, &lsquo;The Hanoverians are only able to reign in
England because the people are free, and believe they
have a right to dispose of the crown. But if the kings
were to claim the same powers as the Stuarts, if they
were to believe that the crown belonged to them by
divine right, they would be condemning themselves and
confessing that they were occupying a place which is
not their own.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> In England, says Helvétius, the
people are respected; every citizen can take some part
in the management of affairs; and authors are allowed
to enlighten the public respecting its own interests.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>
And Brissot, who had made these matters his especial
study, cries out, &lsquo;Admirable constitution! which can
only be disparaged either by men who know it not, or
else by those whose tongues are bridled by slavery.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<p>Such were the opinions of some of the most celebrated
Frenchmen of that time; and it would be easy to fill a
volume with similar extracts. But, what I now rather
wish to do, is, to point out the first great consequence
of this new and sudden admiration for a country which,
in the preceding age, had been held in profound contempt.
The events which followed are, indeed, of
an importance impossible to exaggerate; since they
brought about that rupture between the intellectual and
governing classes, of which the revolution itself was
but a temporary episode.</p>

<p>The great Frenchmen of the eighteenth century
being stimulated by the example of England into a love
of progress, naturally came into collision with the
governing classes, among whom the old stationary spirit
still prevailed. This opposition was a wholesome reaction
against that disgraceful servility for which, in
the reign of Louis XIV., literary men had been remarkable;
and if the contest which ensued had been conducted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
with anything approaching to moderation, the
ultimate result would have been highly beneficial; since
it would have secured that divergence between the
speculative and practical classes which, as we have
already seen, is essential to maintain the balance of
civilization, and to prevent either side from acquiring
a dangerous predominance. But, unfortunately, the
nobles and clergy had been so long accustomed to
power, that they could not brook the slightest contradiction
from those great writers, whom they ignorantly
despised as their inferiors. Hence it was, that when
the most illustrious Frenchmen of the eighteenth century
attempted to infuse into the literature of their
country a spirit of inquiry similar to that which existed
in England, the ruling classes became roused into a
hatred and jealousy which broke all bounds, and gave
rise to that crusade against knowledge which forms the
second principal precursor of the French Revolution.</p>

<p>The extent of that cruel persecution to which literature
was now exposed, can only be fully appreciated by
those who have minutely studied the history of France
in the eighteenth century. For it was not a stray case
of oppression, which occurred here and there; but it
was a prolonged and systematic attempt to stifle all inquiry,
and punish all inquirers. If a list were drawn
up of all the literary men who wrote during the seventy
years succeeding the death of Louis XIV., it would be
found, that at least nine out of every ten had suffered
from the government some grievous injury; and that a
majority of them had been actually thrown into prison.
Indeed, in saying thus much, I am understating the
real facts of the case; for I question if one literary man
out of fifty escaped with entire impunity. Certainly,
my own knowledge of those times, though carefully
collected, is not so complete as I could have wished;
but, among those authors who were punished, I find the
name of nearly every Frenchman whose writings have
survived the age in which they were produced. Among
those who suffered either confiscation, or imprisonment,
or exile, or fines, or the suppression of their works, or
the ignominy of being forced to recant what they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
written, I find, besides a host of inferior writers, the
names of Beaumarchais, Berruyer, Bougeant, Buffon,
D'Alembert, Diderot, Duclos, Freret, Helvétius, La
Harpe, Linguet, Mably, Marmontel, Montesquieu,
Mercier, Morellet, Raynal, Rousseau, Suard, Thomas,
and Voltaire.</p>

<p>The mere recital of this list is pregnant with instruction.
To suppose that all these eminent men deserved
the treatment they received, would, even in the absence
of direct evidence, be a manifest absurdity; since it
would involve the supposition, that a schism having
taken place between two classes, the weaker class was
altogether wrong, and the stronger altogether right.
Fortunately, however, there is no necessity for resorting
to any merely speculative argument respecting the probable
merits of the two parties. The accusations brought
against these great men are before the world; the penalties
inflicted are equally well known; and, by putting these
together, we may form some idea of the state of society,
in which such things could be openly practised.</p>

<p>Voltaire, almost immediately after the death of
Louis XIV., was falsely charged with having composed
a libel on that prince; and, for this imaginary offence,
he, without the pretence of a trial, and without even
the shadow of a proof, was thrown into the Bastille,
where he was confined more than twelve months.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>
Shortly after he was released, there was put upon him
a still more grievous insult; the occurrence, and, above
all, the impunity of which, supply striking evidence as
to the state of society in which such things were permitted.
Voltaire, at the table of the Duke de Sully,
was deliberately insulted by the Chevalier de Rohan
Chabot, one of those impudent and dissolute nobles who
then abounded in Paris. The duke, though the outrage
was committed in his own house, in his own presence,
and upon his own guest, would not interfere; but seemed
to consider that a poor poet was honoured by being in
any way noticed by a man of rank. But, as Voltaire, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the heat of the moment, let fall one of those stinging
retorts which were the terror of his enemies, the chevalier
determined to visit him with further punishment.
The course he adopted was characteristic of the man,
and of the class to which he belonged. He caused
Voltaire to be seized in the streets of Paris, and in his
presence ignominiously beaten, he himself regulating the
number of blows of which the chastisement was to consist.
Voltaire, smarting under the insult, demanded that
satisfaction which it was customary to give. This,
however, did not enter into the plan of his noble assailer,
who not only refused to meet him in the field, but
actually obtained an order, by which he was confined in
the Bastille for six months, and at the end of that time
was directed to quit the country.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></p>

<p>Thus it was that Voltaire, having first been imprisoned
for a libel which he never wrote, and having then
been publicly beaten because he retorted an insult
wantonly put upon him, was now sentenced to another
imprisonment, through the influence of the very man
by whom he had been attacked. The exile which followed
the imprisonment seems to have been soon remitted;
as, shortly after these events, we find Voltaire again in
France, preparing for publication his first historical
work, a life of Charles XII. In this, there are none of
those attacks on Christianity which gave offence in his
subsequent writings; nor does it contain the least reflection
upon the arbitrary government under which he
had suffered. The French authorities at first granted
that permission, without which no book could then be
published; but as soon as it was actually printed,
the license was withdrawn, and the history forbidden to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
be circulated.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> The next attempt of Voltaire was one
of much greater value: it was therefore repulsed still
more sharply. During his residence in England,
his inquisitive mind had been deeply interested
by a state of things so different from any he had
hitherto seen; and he now published an account of
that remarkable people, from whose literature he had
learned many important truths. His work, which he
called <i>Philosophic Letters</i>, was received with general applause;
but, unfortunately for himself, he adopted in it
the arguments of Locke against innate ideas. The
rulers of France, though not likely to know much about
innate ideas, had a suspicion that the doctrine of Locke
was in some way dangerous; and, as they were told
that it was a novelty, they felt themselves bound to prevent
its promulgation. Their remedy was very simple.
They ordered that Voltaire should be again arrested
and that his work should be burned by the common
hangman.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a></p>

<p>These repeated injuries might well have moved a more
patient spirit than that of Voltaire.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> Certainly, those
who reproach this illustrious man, as if he were the instigator
of unprovoked attacks upon the existing state
of things, must know very little of the age in which it
was his misfortune to live. Even on what has been
always considered the neutral ground of physical science,
there was displayed the same despotic and persecuting
spirit. Voltaire, among other schemes for benefiting
France, wished to make known to his countrymen the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
wonderful discoveries of Newton, of which they were
completely ignorant. With this view, he drew up an
account of the labours of that extraordinary thinker;
but here again the authorities interposed, and forbade
the work to be printed.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> Indeed, the rulers of France,
as if sensible that their only security was the ignorance
of the people, obstinately set their face against every
description of knowledge. Several eminent authors had
undertaken to execute, on a magnificent scale, an Encyclopædia,
which should contain a summary of all the
branches of science and of art. This, undoubtedly the
most splendid enterprise ever started by a body of literary
men, was at first discouraged by the government,
and afterwards entirely prohibited.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> On other occasions,
the same tendency was shown in matters so trifling
that nothing but the gravity of their ultimate
results prevents them from being ridiculous. In 1770,
Imbert translated Clarke's <i>Letters on Spain</i>: one of the
best works then existing on that country. This book,
however, was suppressed as soon as it appeared;
and the only reason assigned for such a stretch of power
is, that it contained some remarks respecting the passion
of Charles III. for hunting, which were considered disrespectful
to the French crown, because Louis XV. was
himself a great hunter.<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> Several years before this,
La Bletterie, who was favourably known in France by
his works, was elected a member of the French Academy.
But he, it seems, was a Jansenist, and had, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
ventured to assert that the Emperor Julian, notwithstanding
his apostacy, was not entirely devoid of
good qualities. Such offences could not be overlooked
in so pure an age; and the king obliged the Academy to
exclude La Bletterie from their society.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> That the
punishment extended no further, was an instance of
remarkable leniency; for Fréret, an eminent critic and
scholar,<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> was confined in the Bastille, because he stated
in one of his memoirs, that the earliest Frankish chiefs
had received their titles from the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> The same

man, there seems to have been hardly the shadow
of a pretext for the cruelty with which he was treated;
though, on one occasion, the alleged offence was, that
he had published a supplement to the History of De

the whole of his labours rendered useless, and
the prospects of his life suddenly blighted, was unable
to survive the shock. He was struck with apoplexy,
and within twenty-four hours was lying a corpse in his

<p>It will probably be allowed that I have collected sufficient
evidence to substantiate my assertion respecting
the persecutions directed against every description of
literature; but the carelessness with which the antecedents
of the French Revolution have been studied, has
given rise to such erroneous opinions on this subject,
that I am anxious to add a few more instances, so as to
put beyond the possibility of doubt the nature of the
provocations habitually received by the most eminent
Frenchmen of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Among the many celebrated authors who, though, inferior
to Voltaire, Montesquieu, Buffon, and Rousseau,
were second only to them, three of the most remarkable
were Diderot, Marmontel, and Morellet. The first two
are known to every reader; while Morellet, though comparatively
forgotten, had in his own time considerable
influence, and had, moreover, the distinguished merit of
being the first who popularized in France those great
truths which had been recently discovered in political
economy by Adam Smith, and in jurisprudence by
Beccaria.</p>

<p>A certain M. Cury wrote a satire upon the Duke
d'Aumont, which he showed to his friend Marmontel,
who, struck by its power, repeated it to a small circle of
his acquaintance. The duke, hearing of this, was full of
indignation, and insisted upon the name of the author
being given up. This, of course, was impossible without
a gross breach of confidence; but Marmontel, to do
everything in his power, wrote to the duke, stating,
what was really the fact, that the lines in question had
not been printed, that there was no intention of making
them public, and that they had only been communicated
to a few of his own particular friends. It might have
been supposed that this would have satisfied even a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
French noble; but Marmontel, still doubting the result,
sought an audience of the minister, in the hope of procuring
the protection of the crown. All, however, was in
vain. It will hardly be believed, that Marmontel, who
was then at the height of his reputation, was seized in
the middle of Paris, and because he refused to betray his
friend, was thrown into the Bastille. Nay, so implacable
were his persecutors, that after his liberation from prison
they, in the hope of reducing him to beggary, deprived
him of the right of publishing the <i>Mercure</i>, upon which
nearly the whole of his income depended.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a></p>

<p>To the Abbé Morellet a somewhat similar circumstance
occurred. A miserable scribbler, named Palissot,
had written a comedy ridiculing some of the ablest
Frenchmen then living. To this Morellet replied by a
pleasant little satire, in which he made a very harmless
allusion to the Princess de Robeck, one of Palissot's
patrons. She, amazed at such presumption, complained
to the minister, who immediately ordered the abbé to be
confined in the Bastille, where he remained for some
months, although he had not only been guilty of no
scandal, but had not even mentioned the name of the
princess.<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a></p>

<p>The treatment of Diderot was still more severe. This
remarkable man owed his influence chiefly to his immense
correspondence, and to the brilliancy of a conversation
for which, even in Paris, he was unrivalled, and
which he used to display with considerable effect at
those celebrated dinners where, during a quarter of a
century, Holbach assembled the most illustrious thinkers
in France.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> Besides this, he is the author of several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
works of interest, most of which are well known to the
students of French literature.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> His independent spirit,
and the reputation he obtained, earned for him a share
in the general persecution. The first work he wrote
was ordered to be publicly burned by the common
hangman.<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> This, indeed, was the fate of nearly all
the best literary productions of that time; and Diderot
might esteem himself fortunate in merely losing his
property, provided he saved himself from imprisonment.
But, a few years later, he wrote another work, in which
he said that people who are born blind have some
ideas different from those who are possessed of their
eyesight. This assertion is by no means improbable,<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
and it contains nothing by which any one need be
startled. The men, however, who then governed France
discovered in it some hidden danger. Whether they
suspected that the mention of blindness was an allusion
to themselves, or whether they were merely instigated
by the perversity of their temper, is uncertain; at all
events, the unfortunate Diderot, for having hazarded
this opinion, was arrested, and without even the form
of a trial, was confined in the dungeon of Vincennes.<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a>
The natural results followed. The works of Diderot rose
in popularity;<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> and he, burning with hatred against
his persecutors, redoubled his efforts to overthrow those
institutions, under shelter of which such monstrous
tyranny could be safely practised.</p>

<p>It seems hardly necessary to say more respecting the
incredible folly with which the rulers of France, by turning
every able man into a personal enemy,<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> at length
arrayed against the government all the intellect of the
country, and made the Revolution a matter not of choice
but of necessity. I will, however, as a fitting sequel to
the preceding facts, give one instance of the way in
which, to gratify the caprice of the higher classes, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the most private affections of domestic life, could be
publicly outraged. In the middle of the eighteenth
century, there was an actress on the French stage of
the name of Chantilly. She, though beloved by Maurice
de Saxe, preferred a more honourable attachment, and
married Favart, the well-known writer of songs and
of comic operas. Maurice, amazed at her boldness, applied
for aid to the French crown. That he should
have made such an application is sufficiently strange;
but the result of it is hardly to be paralleled except in
some Eastern despotism. The government of France,
on hearing the circumstance, had the inconceivable
baseness to issue an order directing Favart to abandon
his wife, and intrust her to the charge of Maurice, to
whose embraces she was compelled to submit.<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a></p>

<p>These are among the insufferable provocations, by
which the blood of men is made to boil in their veins.
Who can wonder that the greatest and noblest minds in
France were filled with loathing at the government by
whom such things were done? If we, notwithstanding
the distance of time and country, are moved to indignation
by the mere mention of them, what must have
been felt by those before whose eyes they actually
occurred? And when, to the horror they naturally
inspired, there was added that apprehension of being
the next victim which every one might personally feel;
when, moreover, we remember that the authors of these
persecutions had none of the abilities by which even
vice itself is sometimes ennobled;&mdash;when we thus contrast
the poverty of their understandings with the greatness
of their crimes, we, instead of being astonished
that there was a revolution, by which all the machinery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
of the state was swept away, should rather be amazed
at that unexampled patience by which alone the revolution
was so long deferred.</p>

<p>To me, indeed, it has always appeared, that the delay of
the Revolution is one of the most striking proofs history
affords of the force of established habits, and of the
tenacity with which the human mind clings to old associations.
For, if ever there existed a government inherently
and radically bad, it was the government of France
in the eighteenth century. If ever there existed a state
of society likely, by its crying and accumulated evils, to
madden men to desperation, France was in that state.
The people, despised and enslaved, were sunk in abject
poverty, and were curbed by laws of stringent cruelty,
enforced with merciless barbarism. A supreme and
irresponsible control was exercised over the whole
country by the clergy, the nobles, and the crown. The
intellect of France was placed under the ban of a ruthless
proscription, its literature prohibited and burned,
its authors plundered and imprisoned. Nor was there
the least symptom that these evils were likely to be
remedied. The upper classes, whose arrogance was
increased by the long tenure of their power, only
thought of present enjoyment: they took no heed of the
future: they saw not that day of reckoning, the bitterness
of which they were soon to experience. The
people remained in slavery until the Revolution actually
occurred; while as to the literature, nearly every year
witnessed some new effort to deprive it of that share of
liberty which it still retained. Having, in 1764, issued
a decree forbidding any work to be published in which
questions of government were discussed;<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> having, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
1767, made it a capital offence to write a book likely to
excite the public mind;<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> and having, moreover, denounced
the same penalty of death against any one who
attacked religion,<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> as also against any one who spoke
of matters of finance;<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a>&mdash;having taken these steps, the
rulers of France, very shortly before their final fall,
contemplated another measure still more comprehensive.
It is, indeed, a singular fact, that only nine
years before the Revolution, and when no power on
earth could have saved the institutions of the country,
the government was so ignorant of the real state of
affairs, and so confident that it could quell the spirit
which its own despotism had raised, that a proposal
was made by an officer of the crown to do away with
all the publishers, and not allow any books to be
printed except those which were issued from a press
paid, appointed, and controlled by the executive magistrate.<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>
This monstrous proposition, if carried into
effect, would of course have invested the king with all
the influence which literature can command; it would
have been as fatal to the national intellect as the other
measures were to national liberty; and it would have
consummated the ruin of France, either by reducing
its greatest men to complete silence, or else by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
degrading them into mere advocates of those opinions
which the government might wish to propagate.</p>

<p>For these are by no means to be considered as trifling
matters, merely interesting to men of letters. In
France, in the eighteenth century, literature was the
last resource of liberty. In England, if our great authors
should prostitute their abilities by inculcating
servile opinions, the danger would no doubt be considerable,
because other parts of society might find
it difficult to escape the contagion. Still, before the
corruption had spread, there would be time to stop
its course, so long as we possessed those free political
institutions, by the mere mention of which the generous
imagination of a bold people is easily fired. And
although such institutions are the consequence, not
the cause, of liberty, they do unquestionably react
upon it, and from the force of habit they could for
a while survive that from which they originally sprung.
So long as a country retains its political freedom,
there will always remain associations by which, even
in the midst of mental degradation, and out of the
depths of the lowest superstition, the minds of men
may be recalled to better things. But in France such
associations had no existence. In France everything
was for the governors and nothing for the governed.
There was neither free press, nor free parliament,
nor free debates. There were no public meetings;
there was no popular suffrage; there was no discussion
on the hustings; there was no habeas-corpus
act; there was no trial by jury. The voice of liberty,
thus silenced in every department of the state, could
only be heard in the appeals of those great men,
who, by their writings, inspirited the people to resistance.
This is the point of view from which we
ought to estimate the character of those who are often
accused of having wantonly disturbed the ancient
fabric.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> They, as well as the people at large, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
cruelly oppressed by the crown, the nobles, and the
church; and they used their abilities to retaliate the
injury. There can be no doubt that this was the best
course open to them. There can be no doubt that rebellion
is the last remedy against tyranny, and that a despotic
system should be encountered by a revolutionary
literature. The upper classes were to blame, because they
struck the first blow; but we must by no means censure
those great men, who, having defended themselves from
aggression, eventually succeeded in smiting the government
by whom the aggression was originally made.</p>

<p>Without, however, stopping to vindicate their conduct,
we have now to consider what is much more important,
namely, the origin of that crusade against
Christianity, in which, unhappily for France, they were
compelled to embark, and the occurrence of which forms
the third great antecedent of the French Revolution.
A knowledge of the causes of this hostility against
Christianity is essential to a right understanding of the
philosophy of the eighteenth century, and it will throw
some light on the general theory of ecclesiastical power.</p>

<p>It is a circumstance well worthy of remark, that the
revolutionary literature which eventually overturned all
the institutions of France, was at first directed against
those which were religious, rather than against those
which were political. The great writers who rose into
notice soon after the death of Louis XIV., exerted
themselves against spiritual despotism; while the overthrow
of secular despotism was left to their immediate
successors.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> This is not the course which would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
pursued in a healthy state of society; and there is no
doubt, that to this peculiarity the crimes and the lawless
violence of the French Revolution are in no small degree
to be ascribed. It is evident, that in the legitimate
progress of a nation, political innovations should keep
pace with religious innovations, so that the people may
increase their liberty while they diminish their superstition.
In France, on the contrary, during nearly forty
years, the church was attacked, and the government
was spared. The consequence was, that the order and
balance of the country were destroyed; the minds of
men became habituated to the most daring speculations,
while their acts were controlled by the most oppressive
despotism; and they felt themselves possessed of capacities
which their rulers would not allow them to employ.
When, therefore, the French Revolution broke
out, it was not a mere rising of ignorant slaves against
educated masters, but it was a rising of men in whom
the despair caused by slavery was quickened by the
resources of advancing knowledge; men who were in
that frightful condition when the progress of intellect
outstrips the progress of liberty, and when a desire is
felt, not only to remove a tyranny, but also to avenge
an insult.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that to this we must ascribe
some of the most hideous peculiarities of the French
Revolution. It, therefore, becomes a matter of great
interest to inquire how it was, that while in England
political freedom and religious sceptism have accompanied
and aided each other, there should, on the other
hand, have taken place in France a vast movement, in
which, during nearly forty years, the ablest men neglected
the freedom, while they encouraged the scepticism,
and diminished the power of the church, without increasing
the liberties of the people.</p>

<p>The first reason of this appears to be, the nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
those ideas out of which the French had long constructed
the traditions of their glory. A train of circumstances
which, when treating of the protective spirit, I attempted
to indicate, had secured to the French kings an
authority which, by making all classes subordinate to
the crown, flattered the popular vanity.<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> Hence it
was, that in France the feelings of loyalty worked into
the national mind deeper than in any other country of
Europe, Spain alone excepted.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> The difference between
this spirit and that observable in England has
been already noticed, and may be still further illustrated
by the different ways in which the two nations have
dealt with the posthumous reputation of their sovereigns.
With the exception of Alfred, who is sometimes
called the Great,<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> we in England have not sufficiently
loved any of our princes to bestow upon them titles
expressive of personal admiration. But the French
have decorated their kings with every variety of panegyric.
Thus, to take only a single name, one king is
Louis the Mild, another is Louis the Saint, another is
Louis the Just, another is Louis the Great, and the
most hopelessly vicious of all was called Louis the
Beloved.</p>

<p>These are facts which, insignificant as they seem,
form most important materials for real history, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
they are unequivocal symptoms of the state of the
country in which they exist.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> Their relation to the
subject before us is obvious. For, by them, and by the
circumstances from which they sprung, an intimate and
hereditary association was engendered in the minds of
Frenchmen, between the glory of their nation and the
personal reputation of their sovereign. The consequence
was, that the political conduct of the rulers of France
was protected against censure by a fence far more impassable
than any that could be erected by the most
stringent laws. It was protected by those prejudices
which each generation bequeathed to its successor. It
was protected by that halo which time had thrown
round the oldest monarchy in Europe.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> And above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
all, it was protected by that miserable national vanity,
which made men submit to taxation and to slavery, in
order that foreign princes might be dazzled by the
splendour of their sovereign, and foreign countries intimidated
by the greatness of his victories.</p>

<p>The upshot of all this was, that when, early in the
eighteenth century, the intellect of France began to be
roused into action, the idea of attacking the abuses of the
monarchy never occurred even to the boldest thinker.
But, under the protection of the crown, there had grown
up another institution, about which less delicacy was
felt. The clergy, who for so long a period had been
allowed to oppress the consciences of men, were not
sheltered by those national associations which surrounded
the person of the sovereign; nor had any of
them, with the single exception of Bossuet, done much
to increase the general reputation of France. Indeed,
the French church, though during the reign of Louis
XIV. it possessed immense authority, had always exercised
it in subordination to the crown, at whose
bidding it had not feared to oppose even the pope himself.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>
It was, therefore, natural, that in France the
ecclesiastical power should be attacked before the temporal
power; because, while it was as despotic, it was
less influential, and because it was unprotected by those
popular traditions which form the principal support of
every ancient institution.</p>

<p>These considerations are sufficient to explain why it
was that, in this respect, the French and English intellects
adopted courses so entirely different. In England,
the minds of men, being less hampered with the prejudices
of an indiscriminate loyalty, have been able at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
each successive step in the great progress to direct their
doubts and inquiries on politics as well as on religion;
and thus establishing their freedom as they diminished
their superstition, they have maintained the balance of
the national intellect, without allowing to either of its
divisions an excessive preponderance. But in France
the admiration for royalty had become so great, that
this balance was disturbed; the inquiries of men not
daring to settle on politics, were fixed on religion, and
gave rise to the singular phenomenon of a rich and
powerful literature, in which unanimous hostility to the
church was unaccompanied by a single voice against the
enormous abuses of the state.</p>

<p>There was likewise another circumstance which increased
this peculiar tendency. During the reign of
Louis XIV. the personal character of the hierarchy had
done much to secure their dominion. All the leaders
of the church were men of virtue, and many were men
of ability. Their conduct, tyrannical as it was, seems
to have been conscientious; and the evils which it produced
are merely to be ascribed to the gross impolicy of
entrusting ecclesiastics with power. But after the
death of Louis XIV. a great change took place. The
Clergy, from causes which it would be tedious to investigate,
became extremely dissolute, and often very
ignorant. This made their tyranny more oppressive,
because to submit to it was more disgraceful. The
great abilities and unblemished morals of men like
Bossuet, Fénélon, Bourdaloue, Fléchier, and Mascaron,
diminished in some degree the ignominy which is
always connected with blind obedience. But when they
were succeeded by such bishops and cardinals as Dubois,
Lafiteau, Tencin, and others who flourished under the
regency, it became difficult to respect the heads of the
church, tainted as they were with open and notorious
depravity.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> At the same time that there occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
this unfavourable change among the ecclesiastical rulers,
there also occurred that immense reaction of which I
have endeavoured to trace the early workings. It was
therefore, at the very moment when the spirit of inquiry
became stronger that the character of the Clergy became
more contemptible.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> The great writers who were now
rising in France, were moved to indignation when they
saw that those who usurped unlimited power over
consciences had themselves no consciences at all. It is
evident, that every argument which they borrowed from
England against ecclesiastical power, would gain additional
force when directed against men whose personal
unfitness was universally acknowledged.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></p>

<p>Such was the position of the rival parties, when,
almost immediately after the death of Louis XIV., there
began that great struggle between authority and reason,
which is still unfinished, although in the present state
of knowledge its result is no longer doubtful. On the
one side there was a compact and numerous priesthood,
supported by the prescription of centuries and by the
authority of the crown. On the other side there was a
small body of men, without rank, without wealth, and
as yet without reputation, but animated by a love of
liberty, and by a just confidence in their own abilities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Unfortunately, they at the very outset committed a
serious error. In attacking the clergy, they lost their
respect for religion. In their determination to weaken
ecclesiastical power, they attempted to undermine the
foundations of Christianity. This is deeply to be regretted
for their own sake, as well as for its ultimate
effects in France; but it must not be imputed to them
as a crime, since it was forced on them by the exigencies
of their position. They saw the frightful evils which
their country was suffering from the institution of
priesthood as it then existed; and yet they were told
that the preservation of that institution in its actual
form was essential to the very being of Christianity.
They had always been taught that the interests of the
clergy were identical with the interests of religion; how
then could they avoid including both clergy and religion
in the same hostility? The alternative was cruel; but
it was one from which, in common honesty, they had no
escape. We, judging these things by another standard,
possess a measure which they could not possibly have.
We should not now commit such an error, because we
know that there is no connexion between any one particular
form of priesthood and the interests of Christianity.
We know that the clergy are made for the
people, and not the people for the clergy. We know
that all questions of church government are matters,
not of religion, but of policy, and should be settled, not
according to traditional dogmas, but according to large
views of general expediency. It is because these propositions
are now admitted by all enlightened men,
that in our country the truths of religion are rarely
attacked except by superficial thinkers. If, for instance,
we were to find that the existence of our bishops, with
their privileges and their wealth, is unfavourable to the
progress of society, we should not on that account feel
enmity against Christianity; because we should remember
that episcopacy is its accident, and not its
essential, and that we could do away with the institution
and yet retain the religion. In the same way, if we
should ever find, what was formerly found in France,
that the clergy were tyrannical, this would excite in us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
an opposition, not to Christianity, but merely to the external
form which Christianity assumed. So long as
our clergy confine themselves to the beneficent duties of
their calling, to the alleviation of pain and distress,
either bodily or mental, so long will we respect them
as the ministers of peace and of charity. But if they
should ever again entrench on the rights of the laity,&mdash;if
they should ever again interfere with an authoritative
voice in the government of the state,&mdash;it will then be
for the people to inquire, whether the time has not come
to effect a revision of the ecclesiastical constitution of
the country. This, therefore, is the manner in which
we now view these things. What we think of the
clergy will depend upon themselves; but will have no
connection with what we think of Christianity. We
look on the clergy as a body of men who, notwithstanding
their disposition to intolerance, and notwithstanding
a certain narrowness incidental to their
profession, do undoubtedly form part of a vast and
noble institution, by which the manners of men have
been softened, their sufferings assuaged, their distresses
relieved. As long as this institution performs its functions,
we are well content to let it stand. If, however,
it should be out of repair, or if it should be found inadequate
to the shifting circumstances of an advancing
society, we retain both the power and the right of
remedying its faults; we may, if need be, remove some
of its parts; but we would not, we dare not, tamper
with those great religious truths which are altogether
independent of it; truths which comfort the mind of
man, raise him above the instincts of the hour, and infuse
into him those lofty aspirations which, revealing to
him his own immortality, are the measure and the
symptom of a future life.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this was not the way in which these
matters were considered in France. The government
of that country, by investing the clergy with great
immunities, by treating them as if there were something
sacred about their persons, and by punishing as heresy
the attacks which were made on them, had established
in the national mind an indissoluble connexion between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
their interests and the interests of Christianity. The
consequence was, that when the struggle began, the
ministers of religion, and religion itself, were both
assailed with equal zeal. The ridicule, and even the
abuse, heaped on the clergy, will surprise no one who is
acquainted with the provocation that had been received.
And although, in the indiscriminate onslaught which
soon followed, Christianity was, for a time, subjected to
a fate which ought to have been reserved for those who
called themselves her ministers; this, while it moves us
to regret, ought by no means to excite our astonishment.
The destruction of Christianity in France was the necessary
result of those opinions which bound up the destiny
of the national priesthood with the destiny of the
national religion. If both were connected by the same
origin, both should fall in the same ruin. If that which
is the tree of life, were, in reality, so corrupt that it
could only bear poisonous fruits, then it availed little to
lop off the boughs and cut down the branches; but it
were better, by one mighty effort, to root it up from
the ground, and secure the health of society by stopping
the very source of the contagion.</p>

<p>These are reflections which must make us pause before
we censure the deistical writers of the eighteenth
century. So perverted, however, are the reasonings
to which some minds are accustomed, that those who
judge them most uncharitably are precisely those whose
conduct forms their best excuse. Such are the men
who, by putting forth the most extravagant claims
in favour of the clergy, are seeking to establish the
principle, by the operation of which the clergy were
destroyed. Their scheme for restoring the old system
of ecclesiastical authority depends on the supposition
of its divine origin: a supposition which, if inseparable
from Christianity, will at once justify the infidelity
which they hotly attack. The increase of the
power of the clergy is incompatible with the interests
of civilization. If, therefore, any religion adopts as its
creed the necessity of such an increase, it becomes the
bounden duty of every friend to humanity to do his
utmost, either to destroy the creed, or failing in that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
to overturn the religion. If pretensions of this sort are
an essential part of Christianity, it behoves us at once
to make our choice; since the only option can be,
between abjuring our faith or sacrificing our liberty.
Fortunately, we are not driven to so hard a strait; and
we know that these claims are as false in theory, as
they would be pernicious in practice. It is, indeed,
certain, that if they were put into execution, the clergy,
though they might enjoy a momentary triumph, would
have consummated their own ruin, by preparing the
way among us for scenes as disastrous as those which
occurred in France.</p>

<p>The truth is, that what is most blamed in the great
French writers, was the natural consequence of the
development of their age. Never was there a more
striking illustration of the social law already noticed,
that, if government will allow religious scepticism to
run its course, it will issue in great things, and will
hasten the march of civilization; but that, if an attempt
is made to put it down with a strong hand, it may, no
doubt, be repressed for a time, but eventually will rise
with such force as to endanger the foundation of
society. In England, we adopted the first of these
courses; in France, they adopted the second. In
England, men were allowed to exercise their own
judgment on the most sacred subjects; and, as soon as
the diminution of their credulity had made them set
bounds to the power of the clergy, toleration immediately
followed, and the national prosperity has never
been disturbed. In France, the authority of the clergy
was increased by a superstitious king; faith usurped
the place of reason, not a whisper of doubt was allowed
to be heard, and the spirit of inquiry was stifled, until
the country fell to the brink of ruin. If Louis XIV.
had not interfered with the natural progress, France,
like England, would have continued to advance. After
his death, it was, indeed, too late to save the clergy,
against whom all the intellect of the nation was
soon arrayed. But the force of the storm might still
have been broken, if the government of Louis XV.
had conciliated what it was impossible to resist; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
instead of madly attempting to restrain opinions by laws,
had altered the laws to suit the opinions. If the rulers
of France, instead of exerting themselves to silence the
national literature, had yielded to its suggestions, and
had receded before the pressure of advancing knowledge,
the fatal collision would have been avoided;
because the passions which caused the collision would
have been appeased. In such case, the church would
have fallen somewhat earlier; but the state itself would
have been saved. In such case, France would, in all
probability, have secured her liberties, without increasing
her crimes; and that great country, which,
from her position and resources, ought to be the pattern
of European civilization, might have escaped the ordeal
of those terrible atrocities, through which she was compelled
to pass, and from the effects of which she has
not yet recovered.</p>

<p>It must, I think, be admitted that, during, at all
events, the first half of the reign of Louis XV., it was
possible, by timely concessions, still to preserve the
political institutions of France. Reforms there must
have been; and reforms too of a large and uncompromising
character. So far, however, as I am able to
understand the real history of that period, I make no
doubt that, if these had been granted in a frank and
ungrudging spirit, everything could have been retained
necessary for the only two objects at which government
ought to aim, namely, the preservation of order, and
the prevention of crime. But, by the middle of the
reign of Louis XV., or, at all events, immediately afterwards,
the state of affairs began to alter; and, in the
course of a few years, the spirit of France became so
democratic, that it was impossible even to delay a
revolution, which, in the preceding generation, might
have been altogether averted. This remarkable change
is connected with that other change already noticed, by
virtue of which, the French intellect began, about the
same period, to direct its hostility against the state,
rather than, as heretofore, against the church. As soon
as this, which may be called the second epoch of the
eighteenth century, had been fairly entered, the movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
became irresistible. Event after event followed
each other in rapid succession; each one linked to its
antecedent, and the whole forming a tendency impossible
to withstand. It was in vain that the government,
yielding some points of real importance, adopted
measures by which the church was controlled, the
power of the clergy diminished, and even the order of
the jesuits suppressed. It was in vain that the crown
now called to its councils, for the first time, men imbued
with the spirit of reform; men, like Turgot and
Necker, whose wise and liberal proposals would, in
calmer days, have stilled the agitation of the popular
mind. It was in vain that promises were made to
equalize the taxes, to redress some of the most crying
grievances, to repeal some of the most obnoxious laws.
It was even in vain that the states-general were summoned;
and that thus, after the lapse of a hundred
and seventy years, the people were again admitted to
take part in the management of their own affairs. All
these things were in vain; because the time for treaty
had gone by, and the time for battle had come. The
most liberal concessions that could possibly have been
devised would have failed to avert that deadly struggle,
which the course of preceding events made inevitable.
For the measure of that age was now full. The upper
classes, intoxicated by the long possession of power, had
provoked the crisis; and it was needful that they should
abide the issue. There was no time for mercy; there
was no pause, no compassion, no sympathy. The only
question that remained was, to see whether they who
had raised the storm could ride the whirlwind; or,
whether it was not rather likely that they should be the
first victims of that frightful hurricane, in which, for a
moment, laws, religion, morals, all perished, the lowest
vestiges of humanity were effaced, and the civilization
of France not only submerged, but, as it then appeared,
irretrievably ruined.</p>

<p>To ascertain the successive changes of this, the second
epoch of the eighteenth century, is an undertaking
full of difficulty; not only on account of the rapidity
with which the events occurred, but also on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
their extreme complication, and of the way in which
they acted and reacted upon each other. The materials,
however, for such an inquiry are very numerous; and,
as they consist of evidence supplied by all classes and
all interests, it has appeared to me possible to reconstruct
the history of that time, according to the only
manner in which history deserves to be studied; that
is to say, according to the order of its social and intellectual
development. In the seventh chapter of
the present volume, I shall, therefore, attempt to trace
the antecedents of the French Revolution during that
remarkable period, in which the hostility of men,
slackening in regard to the abuses of the church, was,
for the first time, turned against the abuses of the
state. But, before entering into this, which may be
distinguished as the political epoch of the eighteenth
century, it will be necessary, according to the plan
which I have sketched, to examine the changes that occurred
in the method of writing history, and to indicate
the way in which those changes were affected by the
tendencies of the earlier, or, as it may be termed, the
ecclesiastical epoch. In this manner, we shall the more
easily understand the activity of that prodigious movement
which led to the French Revolution; because we
shall see that it not only affected the opinions of men in regard
to what was passing under their eyes, but that it also
biased their speculative views in regard to the events
of preceding ages; and thus gave rise to that new
school of historical literature, the formation of which
is by no means the least of the many benefits which we
owe to the great thinkers of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The French, during the reign of Louis XIV., principally knew us from the
accounts given by two of their countrymen, Monconys and Sorbière; both
of whom published their travels in England, but neither of whom were
acquainted with the English language. For proof of this, see <i>Monconys</i>,
<i>Voyages</i>, vol. iii. pp. 34, 69, 70, 96; and <i>Sorbière</i>, <i>Voyage</i>, pp.
45, 70.</p>

<p>When Prior arrived at the court of Louis XIV. as plenipotentiary, no one
in Paris was aware that he had written poetry (<i>Lettres sur les
Anglais</i>, in <i>&#338;uvres de Voltaire</i>, vol. xxvi. p. 130);
and when Addison, being in Paris, presented Boileau with
a copy of the <i>Musæ Anglicanæ</i>, the Frenchman learnt for the first time
that we had any good poets: &lsquo;first conceived an opinion of the English
genius for poetry.&rsquo; Tickell's statement, in <i>Aikin's Life of Addison</i>,
vol. i. p. 65. Finally, it is said that Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i> was not
even by report in France until after the death of Louis XIV., though the
poem was published in 1667, and the king died in 1715; &lsquo;Nous n'avions
jamais entendu parler de ce poëme en France, avant que l'auteur de la
Henriade nous en eût donné une idée dans le neuvième chapitre de son
Essai sur la poésie épique.&rsquo; <i>Dict. Philos.</i> article <i>Epopée</i>, in
<i>&#338;uvres de Voltaire</i>, vol. xxxix. p. 175; see also vol. lxvi. p.

which it happened, will be examined in the last chapter of the present
volume; but that the revolutionary movement, while headed by Voltaire
and his coadjutors, was directed against the church, and not against the
state, is noticed by many writers; some of whom have also observed, that
soon after the middle of the reign of Louis XV. the ground began to be
shifted, and a disposition was first shown to attack political abuses.

very unkind to him.&rsquo; <i>Burnet's History of his Own Time</i>, vol. vi. p.

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">STATE OF HISTORICAL LITERATURE IN FRANCE FROM THE END OF
THE SIXTEENTH TO THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.</div>

<p>It may be easily supposed, that those vast movements
in the intellect of France, which I have just traced,
could not fail to produce a great change in the method
of writing history. That bold spirit with which men
were beginning to estimate the transactions of their
own time, was sure to influence their opinions respecting
those of a former age. In this, as in every branch of
knowledge, the first innovation consisted in recognizing
the necessity of doubting what had hitherto been believed;
and this feeling, when once established, went
on increasing, destroying at each step some of those
monstrous absurdities by which, as we have seen, even
the best histories were disfigured. The germs of the
reform may be discerned in the fourteenth century,
though the reform itself did not begin until late in the
sixteenth century. During the seventeenth century, it
advanced somewhat slowly; but in the eighteenth century
it received a sudden accession of strength, and,
in France in particular, it was hastened by that fearless
and inquisitive spirit which characterized the age, and
which, purging history of innumerable follies, raised its
standard, and conferred on it a dignity hitherto unknown.
The rise of historical scepticism, and the extent
to which it spread, do indeed form such curious features
in the annals of the European intellect, as to make it
surprising that no one should have attempted to examine
a movement to which a great department of modern
literature owes its most valuable peculiarities. In the
present chapter, I hope to supply this deficiency so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
as France is concerned; and I shall endeavour to mark
the different steps by which the progress was effected,
in order that, by knowing the circumstances most
favourable to the study of history, we may with the
greater ease inquire into the probability of its future
improvement.</p>

<p>There is, in reference to this subject, a preliminary
consideration well worthy of notice. This is, that men
seem always to have begun to doubt in matters of religion,
before they ventured to do so in matters of history.
It might have been expected that the reproaches,
and, in a superstitious age, the dangers, to which heresy
is exposed, would have intimidated inquirers, and would
have induced them to prefer the safer path of directing
their scepticism upon questions of literary speculation.
Such, however, is by no means the course which the
human mind has adopted. In an early stage of society,
when the clergy had universal influence, a belief in the
unpardonable criminality of religious error is so deeply
rooted, that it engrosses the attention of all; it forces
every one who thinks, to concentrate upon theology his
reflections and his doubts, and it leaves no leisure for
topics which are conceived to be of inferior importance.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>
Hence, during many centuries, the subtlest intellects
of Europe exhausted their strength on the rights and
dogmas of Christianity; and while upon these matters
they often showed the greatest ability, they, upon other
subjects, and especially upon history, displayed that infantine
credulity, of which I have already given several
examples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>But when, in the progress of society, its theological
element begins to decay, the ardour with which religious
disputes were once conducted becomes sensibly
weakened. The most advanced intellects are the first
to feel the growing indifference, and, therefore, they are
also the first to scrutinize real events with that inquisitive
eye which their predecessors had reserved for religious
speculations. This is a great turning-point in the
history of every civilized nation. From this moment
theological heresies become less frequent,<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> and literary
heresies become more common. From this moment the
spirit of inquiry and of doubt fastens itself upon every
department of knowledge, and begins that great career
of conquest, in which by every succeeding discovery the
power and dignity of man are increased, while at the
same time most of his opinions are disturbed, and many
of them are destroyed: until, in the march of this vast
but noiseless revolution, the stream of tradition is, as it
were, interrupted, the influence of ancient authority is
subverted, and the human mind, waxing in strength,
learns to rely upon its own resources, and to throw off
incumbrances by which the freedom of its movements
had long been impaired.</p>

<p>The application of these remarks to the history of
France, will enable us to explain some interesting phenomena
in the literature of that country. During the
whole of the Middle Ages, and I may say till the end of
the sixteenth century, France, though fertile in annalists
and chroniclers, had not produced a single historian,
because she had not produced a single man who presumed
to doubt what was generally believed. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
until the publication of Du Haillan's history of the kings
of France, no one had even attempted a critical digest
of the materials which were known to be extant. This
work appeared in 1576;<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> and the author, at the conclusion
of his labours, could not disguise the pride which he
felt at having accomplished so great an undertaking. In
his dedication to the king he says, &lsquo;I am, sire, the first of
all the French who have written the history of France,
and, in a polite language, shown the grandeur and dignity
of our kings; for before there was nothing but the
old rubbish of chronicles which spoke of them.&rsquo; He
adds in the preface: &lsquo;Only I will say, without presumption
and boasting, that I have done a thing which
had not been done before, or seen by any of our nation,
and have given to the history of France a dress it never
appeared in before.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> Nor were these the idle boasts of
an obscure man. His work went through numerous
editions; was translated into Latin, and was reprinted
in foreign countries. He himself was looked upon as
one of the glories of the French nation, and was rewarded
by the favour of the king, who conferred on
him the office of secretary of finance.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> From his work,
we may, therefore, gain some notion of what was then
the received standard of historical literature; and with
this view, it is natural to inquire what the materials
were which he chiefly employed. About sixty years
earlier, an Italian named Paulus Emilius had published
a gossiping compilation on the &lsquo;Actions of the French.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
This book, which is full of extravagant fables, was taken
by Du Haillan as the basis of his famous history of the
kings of France; and from it he unhesitatingly copies
those idle stories which Emilius loved to relate. This
will give us some idea of the credulity of a writer, who
was reckoned by his contemporaries to be, beyond all
comparison, the greatest historian France had produced.
But this is not all. Du Haillan, not content with borrowing
from his predecessor everything that was most
incredible, gratifies his passion for the marvellous by
some circumstances of his own invention. He begins
his history with a long account of a council which, he
says, was held by the celebrated Pharamond, in order
to determine whether the French should be governed
by a monarchy or by an aristocracy. It is, indeed,
doubtful if any such person as Pharamond ever existed;
and it is certain that, if he did exist, all the materials
had long perished from which an opinion could be formed
respecting him.<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> But Du Haillan, regardless of these
little difficulties, gives us the fullest information touching
the great chieftain; and, as if determined to tax
to the utmost the credulity of his readers, mentions, as
members of the council of Pharamond, two persons,
Charamond and Quadrek, whose very names are invented
by the historian.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the state of historical literature in France
early in the reign of Henry III. A great change was,
however, at hand. The remarkable intellectual progress
made by the French towards the close of the sixteenth
century was, as I have shown, preceded by that scepticism
which appears to be its necessary precursor.
The spirit of doubt, which had begun with religion, was
communicated to literature. The impulse was immediately
felt in every department of knowledge, and now
it was that history first emerged from a debasement
in which it had for centuries been sunk. On this
subject a mere statement of dates may be of service to
those persons who, from a dislike to general reasoning,
would otherwise deny the connexion which I wish to
establish. In 1588 was published the first sceptical
book ever written in the French language.<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> In 1598,
the French government, for the first time, ventured upon
a great public act of religious toleration. In 1604,
De Thou published that celebrated work, which is
allowed by all critics to be the first great history composed
by a Frenchman.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> And at the very moment
when these things were passing, another eminent
Frenchman, the illustrious Sully,<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> was collecting the
materials for his historical work, which, though hardly
equal to that of De Thou, comes immediately after it
in ability, in importance, and in reputation. Nor can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
we fail to remark, that both these great historians, who
left all their predecessors immeasurably behind them,
were the confidential ministers and intimate friends of
Henry IV., the first king of France whose memory is
stained by the imputation of heresy, and the first who
dared to change his religion, not in consequence of any
theological arguments, but on the broad and notorious
ground of political expediency.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a></p>

<p>But it was not merely over such eminent historians
as these that the sceptical spirit displayed its influence.
The movement was now becoming sufficiently active to
leave its marks in the writings of far inferior men.
There were two particulars in which the credulity of
the earlier historians was very striking. These consisted
in the uncritical manner in which, by blindly copying
their predecessors, they confused the dates of different
events; and in the readiness with which they believed
the most improbable statements, upon imperfect evidence,
and often upon no evidence at all. It is surely
a singular proof of that intellectual progress which I am
endeavouring to trace, that, within a very few years,
both these sources of error were removed. In 1597,
Serres was appointed historiographer of France; and, in
the same year, he published his history of that country.<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a>
In this work, he insists upon the necessity of carefully
recording the date of each event; and the example,
which he first set, has, since his time, been generally
followed.<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> The importance of this change will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
willingly acknowledged by those who are aware of the
confusion into which history has been thrown by the
earlier writers having neglected, what now seems, so
obvious a precaution. Scarcely had this innovation
been established, when it was followed, in the same
country, by another of still greater moment. This was
the appearance, in 1621, of a history of France, by
Scipio Dupleix; in which, for the first time, the evidence
for historical facts was published with the facts themselves.<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>
It is needless to insist upon the utility of a
step which, more than any other, has taught historians
to be industrious in collecting their authorities, and
careful in scrutinizing them.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> To this may be added,
that Dupleix was also the first Frenchman who ventured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
to publish a system of philosophy in his own language.<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>
It is true, that the system itself is intrinsically of little
value;<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> but, at the time it appeared, it was an unprecedented,
and, on that account, a profane attempt, to
unfold the mysteries of philosophy in the vulgar speech;
and, in this point of view, supplies evidence of the increasing
diffusion of a spirit bolder and more inquisitive
than any formerly known. It is not, therefore, surprising,
that, almost at the same moment, there should be
made, in the same country, the first systematic attempt
at historical scepticism. The system of philosophy by
Dupleix appeared in 1602; and in 1599, La Popelinière
published at Paris what he calls the <i>History of Histories</i>,
in which he criticizes historians themselves, and examines
their works with that sceptical spirit, to which his
own age was deeply indebted.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> This able man was
also the author of a <i>Sketch of the New History of the
French</i>; containing a formal refutation of that fable, so
dear to the early historians, according to which the
monarchy of France was founded by Francus, who
arrived in Gaul after the conclusion of the siege of
Troy.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>

<p>It would be useless to collect all the instances in
which this advancing spirit of scepticism now began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
purge history of its falsehoods. I will only mention
two or three more of those which have occurred in my
reading. In 1614, De Rubis published at Lyons a work
on the European monarchies; in which he not only
attacks the long-established belief respecting the descent
from Francus, but boldly asserts, that the Franks owe
their name to their ancient liberties.<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> In 1620, Gomberville,
in a dissertation on history, refutes many of
those idle stories respecting the antiquity of the French,
which had been universally received until his time.<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>
And, in 1630, Berthault published at Paris the &lsquo;French
Floras,&rsquo; in which he completely upsets the old method;
since he lays it down as a fundamental principle, that
the origin of the French must only be sought for
in those countries where they were found by the
Romans.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a></p>

<p>All these, and similar productions, were, however,
entirely eclipsed by Mezeray's History of France; the
first volume of which was published in 1643, and the
last in 1651.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> It is, perhaps, hardly fair to his predecessors,
to call him the first general historian of
France;<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> but there can be no doubt that his work is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
greatly superior to any that had yet been seen. The
style of Mezeray is admirably clear and vigorous, rising,
at times, to considerable eloquence. Besides this, he has
two other merits much more important. These are,
an indisposition to believe strange things, merely because
they have hitherto been believed; and an inclination to
take the side of the people, rather than that of their
rulers.<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> Of these principles, the first was too common
among the ablest Frenchmen of that time to excite
much attention.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> But the other principle enabled
Mezeray to advance an important step before all his
contemporaries. He was the first Frenchman who, in
a great historical work, threw off that superstitious
reverence for royalty which had long troubled the minds
of his countrymen, and which, indeed, continued to
haunt them for another century. As a necessary consequence,
he was also the first who saw that a history,
to be of real value, must be a history, not only of kings,
but of nations. A steady perception of this principle
led him to incorporate into his book matters which,
before his time, no one cared to study. He communicates
all the information he could collect respecting the
taxes which the people had paid; the sufferings they had
undergone from the gripping hands of their governors;
their manners, their comforts, even the state of the towns
which they inhabited; in a word, what affected the interests
of the French people, as well as what affected
the interests of the French monarchy.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> These were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the subjects which Mezeray preferred to insignificant
details respecting the pomp of courts and the lives
of kings. These were the large and comprehensive
matters on which he loved to dwell, and on which he
expatiated; not, indeed, with so much fulness as we
could desire, but still with a spirit and an accuracy
which entitles him to the honour of being the greatest
historian France produced before the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>This was, in many respects, the most important
change which had yet been effected in the manner of
writing history. If the plan begun by Mezeray had
been completed by his successors, we should possess
materials, the absence of which no modern researches
can possibly compensate. Some things, indeed, we
should, in that case, have lost. We should know less
than we now know of courts and of camps. We should
have heard less of the peerless beauty of French queens,
and of the dignified presence of French kings. We
might even have missed some of the links of that evidence
by which the genealogies of princes and nobles
are ascertained, and the study of which delights the
curiosity of antiquaries and heralds. But, on the other
hand, we should have been able to examine the state of
the French people during the latter half of the seventeenth
century; while, as things now stand, our knowledge
of them, in that most important period, is inferior
in accuracy and in extent to the knowledge we possess
of some of the most barbarous tribes of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the example of Mezeray had been followed, with such
additional resources as the progress of affairs would
have supplied, we should not only have the means of
minutely tracing the growth of a great and civilised
nation, but we should have materials that would suggest
or verify those original principles, the discovery of
which constitutes the real use of history.</p>

<p>But this was not to be. Unhappily for the interests
of knowledge, the march of French civilization was, at
this period, suddenly checked. Soon after the middle
of the seventeenth century, that lamentable change took
place in France, which gave a new turn to the destinies
of the nation. The reaction which the spirit of inquiry
underwent, and the social and intellectual circumstances
which, by bringing the Fronde to a premature
close, prepared the way for Louis XIV., have been described
in a former part of this volume, where I have
attempted to indicate the general effects of the disastrous
movement. It now remains for me to point out
how this retrogressive tendency opposed obstacles to
the improvement of historical literature, and prevented
authors, not only from relating with honesty what was
passing around them, but also from understanding
events which had occurred before their time.</p>

<p>The most superficial students of French literature
must be struck by the dearth of historians during that
long period in which Louis XIV. held the reins of
government.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> To this, the personal peculiarities of the
king greatly contributed. His education had been
shamefully neglected; and as he never had the energy
to repair its deficiencies, he all his life remained
ignorant of many things with which even princes are
usually familiar.<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> Of the course of past events he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
literally nothing, and he took no interest in any history
except the history of his own exploits. Among a free
people, this indifference on the part of the sovereign
could never have produced injurious results; indeed, as
we have already seen, the absence of royal patronage is,
in a highly civilized country, the most favourable condition
of literature. But at the accession of Louis XIV.
the liberties of the French were still too young, and the
habits of independent thought too recent, to enable
them to bear up against that combination of the crown
and the church, which was directed against them. The
French, becoming every day more servile, at length
sunk so low, that, by the end of the seventeenth century,
they seemed to have lost even the wish of resistance.
The king, meeting no opposition, endeavoured to exercise
over the intellect of the country an authority equal
to that with which he conducted its government.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> In
all the great questions of religion and of politics, the
spirit of inquiry was stifled, and no man was allowed to
express an opinion unfavourable to the existing state of
things. As the king was willing to endow literature,
he naturally thought that he had a right to its services.
Authors, who were fed by his hand, were not to raise
their voices against his policy. They received his wages,
and they were bound to do the bidding of him who paid
them. When Louis assumed the government, Mezeray
was still living; though I need hardly say that his great
work was published before this system of protection and
patronage came into play. The treatment to which he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the great historian of France, was now subjected, was
a specimen of the new arrangement. He received from
the crown a pension of four thousand francs; but when
he, in 1668, published an abridgment of his History,<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a>
it was intimated to him that some remarks upon the
tendency of taxation were likely to cause offence in
high quarters. As, however, it was soon found that
Mezeray was too honest and too fearless to retract what
he had written, it was determined to have recourse to
intimidation, and half of his pension was taken from
him.<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> But as this did not produce a proper effect,
another order was issued, which deprived him of the
remaining half; and thus early, in this bad reign, there
was set an example of punishing a man for writing with
honesty upon a subject in which, of all others, honesty
is the first essential.<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a></p>

<p>Such conduct as this showed what historians were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
expect from the government of Louis XIV. Several
years later, the king took another opportunity of displaying
the same spirit. Fénelon had been appointed
preceptor to the grandson of Louis, whose early vices
his firmness and judgment did much to repress.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> But
a single circumstance was thought sufficient to outweigh
the immense service which Fénelon thus rendered to the
royal family, and, if his pupil had come to the throne,
would have rendered prospectively to the whole of
France. His celebrated romance, <i>Telemachus</i>, was published
in 1699, as it appears, without his consent.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> The
king suspected that, under the guise of a fiction, Fénelon
intended to reflect on the conduct of government. It
was in vain that the author denied so dangerous an
imputation. The indignation of the king was not to be
appeased. He banished Fénelon from the court; and
would never again admit to his presence a man whom
he suspected of even insinuating a criticism upon
the measures adopted by the administration of the
country.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>

<p>If the king could, on mere suspicion, thus treat a
great writer, who had the rank of an archbishop and
the reputation of a saint, it was not likely that he would
deal more tenderly with inferior men. In 1681, the
Abbé Primi, an Italian, then residing at Paris, was induced
to write a history of Louis XIV. The king,
delighted with the idea of perpetuating his own fame,
conferred several rewards upon the author: and arrangements
were made that the work should be composed in
Italian, and immediately translated into French. But
when the history appeared, there were found in it some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
circumstances which it was thought ought not to have
been disclosed. On this account, Louis caused the book
to be suppressed, the papers of the author to be seized,
and the author himself to be thrown into the Bastille.<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a></p>

<p>Those, indeed, were dangerous times for independent
men; times when no writer on politics or religion was
safe, unless he followed the fashion of the day, and defended
the opinions of the court and the church. The
king, who had an insatiable thirst for what he called
glory,<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> laboured to degrade contemporary historians
into mere chroniclers of his own achievements. He
ordered Racine and Boileau to write an account of his
reign; he settled a pension upon them, and he promised
to supply them with the necessary materials.<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> But
even Racine and Boileau, poets though they were, knew
that they would fail in satisfying his morbid vanity;
they, therefore, received the pension, but omitted to
compose the work for which the pension was conferred.
So notorious was the unwillingness of able men to
meddle with history, that it was thought advisable to beat
up literary recruits from foreign countries. The case
of the Abbé Primi has just been mentioned; he was an
Italian, and only one year later a similar offer was made
to an Englishman. In 1683, Burnet visited France, and
was given to understand that he might receive a pension,
and that he might even enjoy the honour of conversing
with Louis himself, provided he would write a history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of the royal affairs; such history, it was carefully added,
being on the &lsquo;side&rsquo; of the French king.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a></p>

<p>Under such circumstances as these, it is no wonder
that history, so far as its great essentials are concerned,
should have rapidly declined during the power of
Louis XIV. It became, as some think, more elegant;
but it certainly became more feeble. The language in
which it was composed was worked with great care, the
periods neatly arranged, the epithets soft and harmonious.
For that was a polite and obsequious age, full
of reverence, of duty, and of admiration. In history,
as it was then written, every king was a hero, and every
bishop was a saint. All unpleasant truths were suppressed;
nothing harsh or unkind was to be told.
These docile and submissive sentiments being expressed
in an easy and flowing style, gave to history that air
of refinement, that gentle, unobtrusive gait, which made
it popular with the classes that it flattered. But even
so, while its form was polished, its life was extinct.
All its independence was gone, all its honesty, all its
boldness. The noblest and the most difficult department
of knowledge, the study of the movements of the
human race, was abandoned to every timid and creeping
intellect that cared to cultivate it. There was
Boulainvilliers, and Daniel, and Maimburg, and Varillas,
and Vertot, and numerous others, who in the reign of
Louis XIV. were believed to be historians; but whose
histories have scarcely any merit, except that of enabling
us to appreciate the period in which such productions
were admired, and the system of which they were
the representatives.</p>

<p>To give a complete view of the decline of historical
literature in France, from the time of Mezeray until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
early in the eighteenth century, would require a summary
of every history which was written; for all of
them were pervaded by the same spirit. But, as this
would occupy much too large a space, it will probably
be thought sufficient if I confine myself to such illustrations
as will bring the tendency of the age most clearly
before the reader; and for this purpose, I will notice the
works of two historians I have not yet mentioned; one
of whom was celebrated as an antiquary, the other as
a theologian. Both possessed considerable learning,
and one was a man of undoubted genius; their works
are, therefore, worth attention, as symptoms of the state
of the French intellect late in the seventeenth century.
The name of the antiquary was Audigier; the name of
the theologian was Bossuet: and from them we may learn
something respecting the way in which, during the reign
of Louis XIV., it was usual to contemplate the transactions
of past ages.</p>

<p>The celebrated work of Audigier, on the Origin of the
French, was published at Paris in 1676.<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> It would be
unjust to deny that the author was a man of great and
careful reading. But his credulity, his prejudices, his
reverence for antiquity, and his dutiful admiration for
everything established by the church and the court,
warped his judgment to an extent which, in our time,
seems incredible; and, as there are probably few persons
in England who have read his once famous book,
I will give an outline of its leading views.</p>

<p>In this great history we are told, that 3464 years after
the creation of the world, and 590 years before the birth
of Christ, was the exact period at which Sigovese, nephew
to the king of the Celts, was first sent into Germany.<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a>
Those who accompanied him were necessarily travellers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
and as, in the German language, <i>wandeln</i> means <i>to go</i>, we
have here the origin of the Vandals.<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> But the antiquity
of the Vandals is far surpassed by that of the
French. Jupiter, Pluto, and Neptune, who are sometimes
supposed to be gods, were in reality kings of
Gaul.<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> And, if we look back a little further, it becomes
certain that Gallus, the founder of Gaul, was no other
than Noah himself; for in those days the same man frequently
had two names.<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> As to the subsequent history
of the French, it was fully equal to the dignity of their
origin. Alexander the Great, even in all the pride of
his victories, never dared to attack the Scythians, who
were a colony sent from France.<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> It is from these great
occupiers of France that there have proceeded all the
gods of Europe, all the fine arts, and all the sciences.<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>
The English themselves are merely a colony of the
French, as must be evident to whoever considers the
similarity of the words Angles and Anjou;<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> and to
this fortunate descent the natives of the British islands
are indebted for such bravery and politeness as they still
possess.<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> Several other points are cleared up by this
great critic with equal faculty. The Salian Franks were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
so called from the rapidity of their flight;<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> the Bretons
were evidently Saxons;<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> and even the Scotch, about
whose independence so much has been said, were vassals
to the kings of France.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> Indeed, it is impossible to exaggerate
the dignity of the crown of France; it is difficult
even to conceive its splendour. Some have supposed that
the emperors are superior to the kings of France, but this
is the mistake of ignorant men; for an emperor means a
mere military ruler, while the title of king includes all
the functions of supreme power.<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> To put the question,
therefore, on its real footing, the great king Louis XIV.
is an emperor, as have been all his predecessors, the
illustrious rulers of France, for fifteen centuries.<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> And
it is an undoubted fact, that Antichrist, about whom so
much anxiety is felt, will never be allowed to appear in
the world until the French empire has been destroyed.
This, says Audigier, it would be idle to deny; for it is
asserted by many of the saints, and it is distinctly foreshadowed
by St. Paul, in his second epistle to the
Thessalonians.<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a></p>

<p>Strange as all this appears, there was nothing in it to
revolt the enlightened age of Louis XIV. Indeed, the
French, dazzled by the brilliancy of their prince, must
have felt great interest in learning how superior he was
to all other potentates, and how he had not only been
preceded by a long line of emperors, but was in fact an
emperor himself. They must have been struck with awe
at the information communicated by Audigier respecting
the arrival of Antichrist, and the connexion between that
important event and the fate of the French monarchy.
They must have listened with pious wonder to the illustration
of these matters from the writings of the fathers,
and from the epistle to the Thessalonians. All this they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
would easily receive; because to worship the king, and
venerate the church, were the two cardinal maxims of
that age. To obey, and to believe, were the fundamental
ideas of a period, in which the fine arts did for
a time flourish,&mdash;in which the perception of beauty,
though too fastidious, was undoubtedly keen,&mdash;in which
taste and the imagination, in its lower departments,
were zealously cultivated,&mdash;but in which, on the other
hand, originality and independence of thought were extinguished,
the greatest and the largest topics were forbidden
to be discussed, the sciences were almost deserted,
reforms and innovations were hated, new opinions were
despised, and their authors punished, until at length,
the exuberance of genius being tamed into sterility, the
national intellect was reduced to that dull and monotonous
level which characterizes the last twenty years
of the reign of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>In no instance can we find a better example of this
reactionary movement, than in the case of Bossuet,
bishop of Meaux. The success, and indeed the mere
existence, of his work on Universal History, becomes,
from this point of view, highly instructive. Considered
by itself, the book is a painful exhibition of a great
genius cramped by a superstitious age. But considered
in reference to the time in which it appeared, it is invaluable
as a symptom of the French intellect; since it
proves, that towards the end of the seventeenth century,
one of the most eminent men, in one of the first countries
of Europe, could willingly submit to a prostration
of judgment, and could display a blind credulity, of
which, in our day, even the feeblest minds would be
ashamed; and that this, so far from causing scandal, or
bringing a rebuke on the head of the author, was received
with universal and unqualified applause. Bossuet
was a great orator, a consummate dialectician, and an
accomplished master of those vague sublimities by
which most men are easily affected. All these qualities
he, a few years later, employed in the production of
what is probably the most formidable work ever directed
against Protestantism.<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> But when he, leaving these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
matters, entered the vast field of history, he could
think of no better way of treating his new subject, than
by following the arbitrary rules peculiar to his own
profession.<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> His work is an audacious attempt to
degrade history to a mere handmaid of theology.<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> As
if, on such matters, doubt were synonymous with crime,
he, without the slightest hesitation, takes everything for
granted which the church had been accustomed to
believe. This enables him to speak with perfect confidence
respecting events which are lost in the remotest
antiquity. He knows the exact number of years which
have elapsed since the moment when Cain murdered
his brother; when the deluge overwhelmed the world;
and when Abraham was summoned to his mission.<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a>
The dates of these, and similar occurrences, he fixes
with a precision, which might almost make us believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
that they had taken place in his own time, if not under
his own eyes.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> It is true, that the Hebrew books on
which he willingly relied, supply no evidence of the
slightest value concerning the chronology even of their
own people; while the information they contain respecting
other countries is notoriously meagre and
unsatisfactory.<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> But so narrow were the views of
Bossuet upon history, that with all this he, in his own
opinion, had no concern. The text of the Vulgate declared,
that these things had happened at a particular
time; and a number of holy men, calling themselves
the council of the church, had, in the middle of the sixteenth
century, pronounced the Vulgate to be authentic,
and had taken upon themselves to place it above all
other versions.<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> This theological opinion was accepted
by Bossuet as an historical law; and thus the decision
of a handful of cardinals and bishops, in a superstitious
and uncritical age, is the sole authority for that early
chronology, the precision of which is, to an uninformed
reader, a matter of great admiration.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same way, because Bossuet had been taught
that the Jews are the chosen people of God, he, under
the title of Universal History, almost confines his attention
to them, and treats this obstinate and ignorant race
as if they formed the pivot upon which the affairs of the
universe had been made to turn.<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> His idea of an universal
history excludes those nations who were the first
to reach civilization, and to some of whom the Hebrews
owed the scanty knowledge which they subsequently
acquired.<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> He says little of the Persians, and less of
the Egyptians; nor does he even mention that far
greater people between the Indus and the Ganges, whose
philosophy formed one of the elements of the school of
Alexandria, whose subtle speculations anticipated all
the efforts of European metaphysics, and whose sublime
inquiries, conducted in their own exquisite language,
date from a period when the Jews, stained with every
variety of crime, were a plundering and vagabond tribe,
wandering on the face of the earth, raising their hand
against every man and every man raising his hand
against them.</p>

<p>When he enters the more modern period, he allows
himself to be governed by the same theological prejudices.
So contracted is his view, that he considers the
whole history of the church as the history of providential
interference; and he takes no notice of the manner
in which, contrary to the original scheme, it has been
affected by foreign events.<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> Thus, for example, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
most important fact relating to the early changes in
Christianity, is the extent to which its doctrines have
been influenced by the African form of the Platonic
philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> But this, Bossuet never mentions; nor
does he even hint that any such thing had occurred.
It suited his views to look upon the church as a perpetual
miracle, and he therefore omits the most important
event in its early history.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> To descend a little
later: every one acquainted with the progress of civilization
will allow, that no small share of it is due to
those gleams of light, which, in the midst of surrounding
darkness, shot from the great centres of Cordova
and Bagdad. These, however, were the work of Mohammedanism;
and as Bossuet had been taught that
Mohammedanism is a pestilential heresy, he could not
bring himself to believe that Christian nations had derived
anything from so corrupt a source. The consequence
is, that he says nothing of that great religion,
the noise of which has filled the world;<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> and having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
occasion to mention its founder, he treats him with
scorn, as an impudent impostor, whose pretensions it is
hardly fitting to notice.<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> The great apostle, who diffused
among millions of idolaters the sublime verity of
one God, is spoken of by Bossuet with supreme contempt;
because Bossuet, with the true spirit of his profession,
could see nothing to admire in those whose opinions differed
from his own.<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> But when he has occasion to mention
some obscure member of that class to which he himself belonged,
then it is that he scatters his praises with boundless
profusion. In his scheme of universal history, Mohammed
is not worthy to play a part. He is passed by; but the truly
great man, the man to whom the human race is really
indebted, is&mdash;Martin, bishop of Tours. He it is, says
Bossuet, whose unrivalled actions filled the universe with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
his fame, both during his lifetime and after his death.<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> It
is true, that not one educated man in fifty has ever heard
the name of Martin, bishop of Tours. But Martin performed
miracles, and the church had made him a saint;
his claims, therefore, to the attention of historians must
be far superior to the claims of one who, like Mohammed,
was without these advantages. Thus it is that, in
the opinion of the only eminent writer on history during
the power of Louis XIV., the greatest man Asia has
ever produced, and one of the greatest the world has
ever seen, is considered in every way inferior to a mean
and ignorant monk, whose most important achievement
was the erection of a monastery, and who spent the
best part of his life in useless solitude, trembling before
the superstitious fancies of his weak and ignoble
nature.<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a></p>

<p>Such was the narrow spirit with which the great
facts of history were contemplated by a writer, who,
when he was confined to his own department, displayed
the most towering genius. This contracted view was
the inevitable consequence of his attempt to explain the
complicated movements of the human race by principles
which he had generalized from his own inferior studies.<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Nor need any one be offended, that, from a scientific
point of view, I assign to the pursuits of Bossuet a
rank lower than that in which they are sometimes
placed. It is certain that religious dogmas do, in many
cases, influence the affairs of men. But it is equally
certain, that as civilization advances, such influence decreases,
and that even when the power of those dogmas
was at its height, there were many other motives by
which the actions of mankind were also governed.
And since the study of history is the study of the
aggregate of these motives, it is evident that history
must be superior to theology; just as the whole is
superior to a part. A neglect of this simple consideration
has, with a few eminent exceptions, led all ecclesiastical
authors into serious errors. It has induced in
them a disposition to disregard the immense variety of
external events, and to suppose that the course of affairs
is regulated by some principles which theology alone
can detect. This, indeed, is only the result of a general
law of the mind, by which those who have any favourite
profession, are apt to exaggerate its capacity; to explain
events by its maxims, and as it were, to refract through
its medium the occurrences of life.<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> Among theologians,
however, such prejudices are more dangerous
than in any other profession, because among them alone
are they fortified by that bold assumption of supernatural
authority on which many of the clergy willingly
rely.</p>

<p>These professional prejudices, when supported by
theological dogmas, in a reign like that of Louis XIV.,<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a>
are sufficient to account for the peculiarities which
mark the historical work of Bossuet. Besides this, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
his case, the general tendency was aggravated by personal
characteristics. His mind was remarkable for a
haughtiness, which we find constantly breaking out
into a general contempt for mankind.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> At the same
time his amazing eloquence, and the effects which it
never failed to produce, seemed to justify the overweening
confidence that he felt in his own powers.
There is, indeed, in some of his greatest efforts, so much
of the fire and majesty of genius, that we are reminded
of those lofty and burning words with which the prophets
of antiquity thrilled their hearers. Bossuet, thus
standing, as he supposed, on an eminence which raised
him above the ordinary weaknesses of men, loved to
taunt them with their follies, and to deride every aspiration
of their genius. Every thing like intellectual
boldness seemed to gall his own superiority.<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> It was
this boundless arrogance with which he was filled,
which gives to his works some of their most marked
peculiarities. It was this, that made him strain every
nerve to abase and vilify those prodigious resources of
the human understanding, which are often despised by
men who are ignorant of them; but which in reality
are so great, that no one has yet arisen able to scan
them in the whole of their gigantic dimensions. It was
this same contempt for the human intellect, that made
him deny its capacity to work out for itself the epochs
through which it has passed; and, consequently, made
him recur to the dogma of supernatural interference.
It was this, again, that, in those magnificent orations
which are among the greatest wonders of modern art,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
caused him to exhaust the language of eulogy, not upon
intellectual eminence, but upon mere military achievements,
upon great conquerors, those pests and destroyers
of men, who pass their lives in discovering new ways of
slaying their enemies, and in devising new means of
aggravating the miseries of the world. And, to descend
still lower, it was this same contempt for the dearest
interests of mankind, which made him look with reverence
upon a king, who considered all those interests as
nothing; but who had the merit of enslaving the mind
of France, and of increasing the power of that body of
men, among whom Bossuet himself was the most distinguished.</p>

<p>In the absence of sufficient evidence respecting the
general state of the French at the end of the seventeenth
century, it is impossible to ascertain to what extent such
notions as these had penetrated the popular mind. But,
looking at the manner in which government had broken
the spirit of the country, I should be inclined to suppose
that the opinions of Bossuet were very acceptable
to his own generation. This, however, is a question
rather of curiosity than of importance; for only a few
years later there appeared the first symptoms of that
unprecedented movement, which not merely destroyed
the political institutions of France, but effected a greater
and more permanent revolution in every department of
the national intellect. At the death of Louis XIV., in
literature, as well as in politics, in religion, and in
morals, everything was ripe for reaction. The materials
still existing are so ample, that it would be possible to
trace with considerable minuteness the steps of this
great process; but it will, I think, be more agreeable
to the general scheme of this Introduction, if I pass
over some of the intermediate links, and confine myself
to those salient instances in which the spirit of the age
is most strikingly portrayed.</p>

<p>There is, indeed, something extraordinary in the
change which, in France, one generation was able to
effect in the method of writing history. The best way,
perhaps, to form an idea of this, will be to compare the
works of Voltaire with those of Bossuet; because these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
great authors were probably the most able, and were
certainly the most influential, Frenchmen during the
period they respectively represented. The first great
improvement which we find in Voltaire, as compared
with Bossuet, is an increased perception of the dignity
of the human intellect. In addition to the circumstances
already noticed, we must remember that the
reading of Bossuet lay in a direction which prevented
him from feeling this. He had not studied those
branches of knowledge where great things have been
achieved; but he was very conversant with the writings
of the saints and fathers, whose speculations are by no
means calculated to give us a high opinion of the resources
of their own understanding. Thus accustomed
to contemplate the workings of the mind in what is, on
the whole, the most puerile literature Europe has ever
produced, the contempt which Bossuet felt for mankind
went on increasing; until it reached that inordinate
degree which, in his later works, is painfully conspicuous.
But Voltaire, who paid no attention to such
things as these, passed his long life in the constant
accumulation of real and available knowledge. His
mind was essentially modern. Despising unsupported
authority, and heedless of tradition, he devoted himself
to subjects in which the triumph of the human reason
is too apparent to be mistaken. The more his knowledge
advanced, the more he admired those vast powers
by which the knowledge had been created. Hence his
admiration for the intellect of man, so far from diminishing,
grew with his growth; and, just in the same
proportion, there was strengthened his love of humanity,
and his dislike to the prejudices which had long obscured
its history. That this, in the march of his mind, was
the course it actually followed, will be evident to any
one who considers the different spirit of his works, in
reference to the different periods of life in which they
were produced.</p>

<p>The first historical work of Voltaire was a life of
Charles XII., in 1728.<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> At this time his knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
was still scanty, and he was still influenced by the
servile traditions of the preceding generation. It is not,
therefore, wonderful, that he should express the greatest
respect for Charles, who, among the admirers of military
fame, will always preserve a certain reputation;
though his only merits are, that he ravaged many countries
and killed many men. But we find little sympathy
with his unfortunate subjects, the accumulations of
whose industry supported the royal armies;<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> nor is
there much pity for those nations who were oppressed
by this great robber in the immense line of his conquests
from Sweden to Turkey. Indeed, the admiration
of Voltaire for Charles is unbounded. He calls him
the most extraordinary man the world had ever seen;<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a>
he declares him to be a prince full of honour;<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> and
while he scarcely blames his infamous murder of Patkul,<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>
he relates with evident emotion how the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
lunatic, at the head of forty servants, resisted an entire
army.<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> In the same way, he says, that after the battle
of Narva, all the attempts of Charles were unable to
prevent medals from being struck at Stockholm in celebration
of that event;<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> although Voltaire well knew
that a man of such extravagant vanity must have been
pleased by so durable a homage, and although it is quite
certain that if he had not been pleased, the medals
would never have been struck: for who would venture,
without an object, to offend, in his own capital, one of
the most arbitrary and revengeful of princes?</p>

<p>So far, it might appear that little had been gained in
the method of writing history.<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> But, even thus early,
we find one vast improvement. In Voltaire's Life of
Charles XII., faulty as it is, there are none of those
assumptions of supernatural interference in which
Bossuet delighted, and which were natural to the reign
of Louis XIV. The absence of this marks the first great
stage in the French school of history in the eighteenth
century; and we find the same peculiarity in all the
subsequent historians, none of whom recurred to a
method, which, though suitable for the purposes of theologians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
is fatal to all independent inquiries, since it not
only prescribes the course the inquirer is bound to
take, but actually sets up a limit beyond which he is
forbidden to proceed.</p>

<p>That Voltaire should have infringed upon this ancient
method only thirteen years after the death of Louis XIV.,
and that he should have done this in a popular work,
abounding with such dangerous adventures as are
always found to tempt the mind to an opposite course,
is a step of no common merit, and becomes still more
worthy of remark, if taken in connexion with another
fact of considerable interest. This is, that the life of
Charles XII. represents the first epoch, not only in the
eighteenth century, but also in the intellect of Voltaire
himself.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> After it was published, this great man turned
awhile from history, and directed his attention to some
of the noblest subjects: to mathematics, to physics,
to jurisprudence, to the discoveries of Newton, and to
the speculations of Locke. In these things he perceived
those capabilities of the human mind, which
his own country had formerly witnessed, but of which
during the authority of Louis XIV. the memory had
been almost lost. Then it was that, with extended
knowledge and sharpened intellect, he returned to the
great field of history.<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> The manner in which he now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
treated his old subject, showed the change that had
come over him. In 1752, appeared his celebrated work
on Louis XIV.,<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> the very title of which is suggestive
of the process through which his mind had passed. His
former history was an account of a king; this is an
account of an age. To the production of his youth he
gave the title of a <i>History of Charles XII.</i>; this he called
the <i>Age of Louis XIV.</i> Before, he had detailed the peculiarities
of a prince; now, he considered the movements
of a people. Indeed, in the introduction to the work,
he announces his intention to describe, &lsquo;not the actions
of a single man, but the character of men.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> Nor, in
this point of view, is the execution inferior to the design.
While he is contented with giving a summary of military
achievements, on which Bossuet hung with delight,
he enters at great length into those really important
matters which, before his time, found no place in the
history of France. He has one chapter on commerce and
internal government;<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> another chapter on finances;<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a>
another on the history of science;<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> and three chapters
on the progress of the fine arts.<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> And though
Voltaire did not attach much value to theological disputes,
still he knew that they have often played a great
part in the affairs of men; he therefore gives several distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
chapters to a relation of ecclesiastical matters during
the reign of Louis.<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> It is hardly necessary to observe
the immense superiority which a scheme like this possessed,
not only over the narrow views of Bossuet, but
even over his own earlier history. Still it cannot be
denied, that we find in it prejudices from which it was
difficult for a Frenchman, educated in the reign of
Louis XIV., to be entirely free. Not only does Voltaire
dwell at needless length upon those amusements and
debaucheries of Louis, with which history can have
little concern, but he displays an evident disposition to
favour the king himself, and to protect his name from
the infamy with which it ought to be covered.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a></p>

<p>But the next work of Voltaire showed that this was
a mere personal feeling, and did not affect his general
views as to the part which the acts of princes ought to
occupy in history. Four years after the appearance of
the <i>Age of Louis XIV.</i>, he published his important
treatise on the <i>Morals, Manners, and Character of Nations</i>.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>
This is not only one of the greatest books
which appeared during the eighteenth century, but it
still remains the best on the subject to which it refers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
The mere reading it displays is immense;<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> what, however,
is far more admirable, is the skill with which the
author connects the various facts, and makes them illustrate
each other, sometimes by a single remark, sometimes
only by the order and position in which they are
placed. Indeed, considered solely as a work of art, it
would be difficult to praise it too highly; while, as a
symptom of the times, it is important to observe, that
it contains no traces of that adulation of royalty
which characterized Voltaire in the period of his youth,
and which is found in all the best writers during the
power of Louis XIV. In the whole of this long and
important work, the great historian takes little notice
of the intrigues of courts, or of the changes of ministers,
or of the fate of kings; but he endeavours to discover
and develop the different epochs through which
Man has successively passed. &lsquo;I wish,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;to write
a history, not of wars, but of society; and to ascertain
how men lived in the interior of their families, and what
were the arts which they commonly cultivated.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> For,
he adds, &lsquo;my object is the history of the human mind,
and not a mere detail of petty facts; nor am I concerned
with the history of great lords, who made war upon
French kings; but I want to know what were the steps
by which men passed from barbarism to civilization.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in this way that Voltaire taught historians
to concentrate their attention on matters of real importance,
and to neglect those idle details with which
history had formerly been filled. But what proves this
to be a movement arising as much from the spirit of the
age as from the individual author, is, that we find precisely
the same tendency in the works of Montesquieu
and Turgot, who were certainly the two most eminent
of the contemporaries of Voltaire; and both of whom
followed a method similar to his, in so far as, omitting
descriptions of kings, courts, and battles, they confined
themselves to points which illustrate the character of
mankind, and the general march of civilization. And
such was the popularity of this change in the old routine,
that its influence was felt by other historians of inferior,
but still of considerable, ability. In 1755, Mallet<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a>
published his interesting, and, at the time it was written,
most valuable work, on the history of Denmark;<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> in
which he professes himself a pupil of the new school.
&lsquo;For why,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;should history be only a recital of
battles, sieges, intrigues, and negotiations? And why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
should it contain merely a heap of petty facts and dates,
rather than a great picture of the opinions, customs,
and even inclinations of a people?&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> Thus too, in
1765, Mably published the first part of his celebrated
work on the history of France;<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> in the preface to
which, he complains that historians &lsquo;have neglected the
origin of laws and customs, in favour of sieges and
battles.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> In the same spirit, Velly and Villaret, in
their voluminous history of France, express regret that
historians should usually relate what happens to the
sovereign, in preference to what happens to the people,
and should omit the manners and characteristics of a
nation, in order to study the acts of a single man.<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>
Duclos, again, announces that his history is not of war,
nor of politics, but of men and manners:<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> while,
strange to say, even the courtly Hénault declares that
his object was to describe laws and manners, which he
calls the soul of history, or rather history itself.<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a></p>

<p>Thus it was, that historians began to shift, as it were,
the scene of their labours, and to study subjects connected
with those popular interests, on which the great
writers under Louis XIV. disdained to waste a thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
I need hardly observe, how agreeable such views were
to the general spirit of the eighteenth century, and how
well they harmonized with the temper of men who were
striving to lay aside their former prejudices, and despise
what had once been universally admired. All this was
but part of that vast movement, which prepared the
way for the Revolution, by unsettling ancient opinions,
by encouraging a certain mobility and restlessness of
mind, and, above all, by the disrespect it showed for
those powerful individuals, hitherto regarded as gods
rather than as men, but who now, for the first time,
were neglected by the greatest and most popular historians,
who passed over even their prominent actions,
in order to dwell upon the welfare of nations, and the
interests of the people at large.</p>

<p>To return, however, to what was actually effected by
Voltaire, there is no doubt that, in his case, this tendency
of the time was strengthened by a natural comprehensiveness
of mind, which predisposed him to large
views, and made him dissatisfied with that narrow range
to which history had been hitherto confined.<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> Whatever
may be thought of the other qualities of Voltaire,
it must be allowed that, in his intellect, everything was
on a great scale.<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> Always prepared for thought, and
always ready to generalize, he was averse to the study
of individual actions, unless they could be made
available for the establishment of some broad and
permanent principle. Hence his habit of looking at
history with a view to the stages through which the
country had passed, rather than with a view to the
character of the men by whom the country had been
governed. The same tendency appears in his lighter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
works; and it has been well observed,<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> that, even in
his dramas, he endeavours to portray, not so much the
passions of individuals, as the spirit of epochs. In
<i>Mahomet</i>, his subject is a great religion; in <i>Alzire</i>, the
conquest of America; in <i>Brutus</i>, the formation of the
Roman power; in the <i>Death of Cæsar</i>, the rise of the
empire upon the ruins of that power.<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a></p>

<p>By this determination to look upon the course of
events as a great and connected whole, Voltaire was
led to several results, which have been complacently
adopted by many authors, who, even while using them,
revile him from whom they were taken. He was the
first historian who, rejecting the ordinary method of
investigation, endeavoured, by large general views, to
explain the origin of feudality; and, by indicating
some of the causes of its decline in the fourteenth
century,<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> he laid the foundation for a philosophic
estimate of that important institution.<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> He was the
author of a profound remark, afterwards adopted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Constant, to the effect, that licentious religious ceremonies
have no connexion with licentious national
morals.<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> Another observation of his, which has been
only partly used by writers on ecclesiastical history, is
pregnant with instruction. He says, that one of the
reasons why the bishops of Rome acquired an authority
so superior to that of the eastern patriarchs, was the
greater subtlety of the Greek mind. Nearly all the
heresies proceeded from the east; and, with the exception
of Honorius I., not a single pope adopted a system
condemned by the church. This gave to the papal
power an unity and consolidation, which the patriarchal
power was unable to reach; and thus the Holy See owes
part of its authority to the early dulness of the
European fancy.<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be impossible to relate all the original remarks
of Voltaire, which, when he made them, were attacked
as dangerous paradoxes, and are now valued as sober
truths. He was the first historian who recommended
universal freedom of trade; and, although he expresses
himself with great caution,<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> still the mere announcement
of the idea in a popular history forms an epoch in
the progress of the French mind. He is the originator
of that important distinction between the increase of
population and the increase of food, to which political
economy has been greatly indebted;<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> a principle
adopted several years later by Townsend, and then used
by Malthus as the basis of his celebrated work.<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
has, moreover, the merit of being the first who dispelled
the childish admiration with which the Middle Ages
had been hitherto regarded, and which they owed to
those dull and learned writers, who, in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, were the principal investigators
of the early history of Europe. These industrious
compilers had collected extensive materials, which
Voltaire turned to good account, and by their aid overthrew
the conclusions at which the authors had themselves
arrived. In his works, the Middle Ages are, for
the first time, represented as what they really were,&mdash;a
period of ignorance, ferocity, and licentiousness; a
period when injuries were unredressed, crime unpunished,
and superstition unrebuked. It may be said,
with some show of justice, that Voltaire, in the picture
he drew, fell into the opposite extreme, and did not
sufficiently recognize the merit of those truly great
men, who, at long intervals, stood here and there, like
solitary beacons, whose light only made the surrounding
darkness more visible. Still, after every allowance for
that exaggeration which a reaction of opinions always
causes, it is certain that his view of the Middle Ages is
not only far more accurate than that of any preceding
writer, but conveys a much juster idea of the time than
can be found in those subsequent compilations which we
owe to the industry of modern antiquaries; a simple
and plodding race, who admire the past because they
are ignorant of the present, and who, spending their
lives amid the dust of forgotten manuscripts, think
themselves able, with the resources of their little
learning, to speculate on the affairs of men, to trace the
history of different periods, and even to assign to each
the praise it ought to receive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>With such writers as these, Voltaire was always at
war; and no one has done so much to lessen the influence
they once exercised over even the highest
branches of knowledge. There was also another class of
dictators, whose authority this great man was equally
successful in reducing, namely, the old class of classical
scholars and commentators, who, from the middle of the
fourteenth till early in the eighteenth century, were the
chief dispensers of fame, and were respected as being
by far the most distinguished men Europe had ever
produced. The first great assaults made upon them
were late in the seventeenth century, when two controversies
sprung up, of which I shall hereafter give an
account,&mdash;one in France, and one in England,&mdash;by both
of which their power was considerably damaged. But
their two most formidable opponents were, undoubtedly,
Locke and Voltaire. The immense services rendered
by Locke in lessening the reputation of the old classical
school, will be examined in another part of this work;
at present we are only concerned with the steps taken
by Voltaire.</p>

<p>The authority wielded by the great classical scholars
rested not only on their abilities, which are undeniable,
but also on the supposed dignity of their pursuits. It
was generally believed that ancient history possessed
some inherent superiority over modern history; and this
being taken for granted, the inference naturally followed,
that the cultivators of the one were more praiseworthy
than the cultivators of the other; and that a Frenchman,
for instance, who should write the history of some
Greek republic, displayed a nobler turn of mind than if
he had written the history of his own country. This
singular prejudice had for centuries been a traditional
notion; which men accepted, because they had received
it from their fathers, and which it would have been
almost an impiety to dispute. The result was, that the
few really able writers on history devoted themselves
chiefly to that of the ancients; or, if they published an
account of modern times, they handled their theme, not
according to modern ideas, but according to ideas gathered
from their more favourite pursuit. This confusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
of the standard of one age with the standard of another,
caused a double evil. Historians, by adopting this plan,
injured the originality of their own minds; and, what
was far worse, they set a bad example to the literature
of their country. For every great nation has a mode of
expression, and of thought, peculiar to itself, and with
which its sympathies are intimately connected. To introduce
any foreign model, however admirable it may
be, is to violate this connexion, and to impair the value
of literature by limiting the scope of its action. By
such a course, the taste may possibly be refined, but the
vigour will certainly be weakened. Indeed, the refinement
of the taste may well be doubted, when we see
what has taken place in our country, where our great
scholars have corrupted the English language by a
jargon so uncouth, that a plain man can hardly discern
the real lack of ideas which their barbarous and mottled
dialect strives to hide.<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> At all events, it is certain,
that every people worthy of being called a nation, possess
in their own language ample resources for expressing
the highest ideas they are able to form; and although,
in matters of science, it may be convenient to coin such
words as are more easily understood in foreign countries,
it is a grave offence to depart on other subjects
from the vernacular speech; and it is a still graver one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
to introduce notions and standards for action, suited
perhaps to former times, but which the march of society
has left far behind, and with which we have no real
sympathy, though they may excite that sickly and artificial
interest which the classical prejudices of early
education still contrive to create.</p>

<p>It was against these evils that Voltaire entered the
field. The wit and the ridicule with which he attacked
the dreaming scholars of his own time, can only be appreciated
by those who have studied his works. Not, as
some have supposed, that he used these weapons as a
substitute for argument, still less that he fell into the
error of making ridicule a test for truth. No one could
reason more closely than Voltaire, when reasoning
suited his purpose. But he had to deal with men impervious
to argument; men whose inordinate reverence
for antiquity had only left them two ideas, namely, that
every thing old is right, and that every thing new is
wrong. To argue against these opinions would be idle
indeed; the only other resource was, to make them ridiculous,
and weaken their influence, by holding up their
authors to contempt. This was one of the tasks Voltaire
set himself to perform; and he did it well.<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> He, therefore,
used ridicule, not as the test of truth, but as the
scourge of folly. And with such effect was the punishment
administered, that not only did the pedants and
theologians of his own time wince under the lash, but
even their successors feel their ears tingle when they
read his biting words; and they revenge themselves by
reviling the memory of that great writer, whose works
are as a thorn in their side, and whose very name they
hold in undisguised abhorrence.</p>

<p>These two classes have, indeed, reasons enough for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
hatred with which they still regard the greatest Frenchman
of the eighteenth century. For, Voltaire did more
than any other man to sap the foundation of ecclesiastical
power, and to destroy the supremacy of classical
studies. This is not the place for discussing the theological
opinions which he attacked; but of the state of classical
opinions an idea may be formed, by considering some
of those circumstances which were recorded by the
ancients respecting their history, and which, until the
appearance of Voltaire, were implicitly believed by
modern scholars, and through them by the people at
large.</p>

<p>It was believed that, in ancient times, Mars ravished
a virgin, and that the offspring of the intrigue were no
other than Romulus and Remus, both of whom it was
intended to put to death; but they were fortunately
saved by the attentions of a she-wolf and a woodpecker;
the wolf giving them suck, and the woodpecker protecting
them from insects. It was, moreover, believed
that Romulus and Remus, when grown up to man's
estate, determined to build a city, and that, being joined
by the descendants of the Trojan warriors, they succeeded
in erecting Rome. It was believed that both
brothers came to an untimely end; Remus being murdered,
and Romulus being taken up to heaven by his
father, who descended for that purpose in the midst of
a tempest. The great scholars then proceeded to relate
the succession of several other kings; the most remarkable
of whom was Numa, whose only communications
with his wife were carried on in a sacred grove. Another
of the sovereigns of Rome was Tullus Hostilius, who,
having offended the clergy, perished from the effects of
their anger; his death being caused by lightning, and
preceded by pestilence. Then again, there was one
Servius Tullius, who was also a king, and whose greatness
was prognosticated by the appearance of flames
round his head as he was sleeping in his cradle. After
this, it was but a slight matter that the ordinary laws
of mortality should be suspended; we were, therefore, assured
that those ignorant barbarians, the early Romans,
passed two hundred and forty-five years under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
government of only seven kings, all of whom were
elected in the prime of life, one of whom was expelled
the city, and three of whom were put to death.</p>

<p>These are a few of the idle stories in which the great
scholars took intense delight, and which, during many
centuries, were supposed to form a necessary part of the
annals of the Latin empire. Indeed, so universal was
the credulity, that, until they were destroyed by Voltaire,
there were only four writers who had ventured openly
to attack them. Cluverius, Perizonius, Pouilly, and
Beaufort were the names of these bold innovators; but
by none of them was any impression made on the
public mind. The works of Cluverius and Perizonius,
being composed in Latin, were addressed entirely to a
class of readers who, infatuated with a love of antiquity,
would listen to nothing that diminished the reputation
of its history. Pouilly and Beaufort wrote in French;
both of them, and especially Beaufort, were men of
considerable ability; but their powers were not versatile
enough to enable them to extirpate prejudices which
were so strongly protected, and which had been fostered
by the education of many successive generations.</p>

<p>The service, therefore, rendered by Voltaire in purging
history of these foolish conceits, is, not that he
was the first by whom they were attacked, but that he
was the first to attack them with success; and this because
he was also the first who mingled ridicule with
argument, thus not only assailing the system, but also
weakening the authority of those by whom the system
was supported. His irony, his wit, his pungent and
telling sarcasms, produced more effect than the gravest
arguments could have done; and there can be no doubt
that he was fully justified in using those great resources
with which nature had endowed him, since by their aid
he advanced the interests of truth, and relieved men
from some of their most inveterate prejudices.</p>

<p>It is not, however, to be supposed that ridicule was
the only means employed by Voltaire in effecting this
important object. So far from that, I can say with
confidence, after a careful comparison of both writers,
that the most decisive arguments advanced by Niebuhr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
against the early history of Rome, had all been anticipated
by Voltaire; in whose works they may be found,
by whoever will take the trouble of reading what this
great man has written, instead of ignorantly railing
against him. Without entering into needless detail, it
is enough to mention that, amidst a great variety of
very ingenious and very learned discussion, Niebuhr has
put forward several views with which later critics have
been dissatisfied; but that there are three, and only
three, principles which are fundamental to his history,
and which it is impossible to refute. These are:&mdash;I.
That, on account of the inevitable intermixture of
fable essential to a rude people, no nation can possess
trustworthy details respecting its own origin. II. That
even such early documents as the Romans might have
possessed, had been destroyed before they were incorporated
into a regular history. III. That ceremonies
established in honour of certain events alleged to have
taken place in former times, were a proof, not that the
events had happened, but that they were believed to
have happened. The whole fabric of the early history
of Rome at once fell to pieces, as soon as these three
principles were applied to it. What, however, is most
remarkable, is, that not only are all three laid down by
Voltaire, but their bearing upon Roman history is distinctly
shown. He says that no nation is acquainted
with its own origin; so that all primitive history is
necessarily an invention.<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> He remarks, that since
even such historical works as the Romans once possessed,
were all destroyed when their city was burned,
no confidence can be placed in the accounts which, at
a much later period, are given by Livy and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
compilers.<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> And, as innumerable scholars busied themselves
in collecting evidence respecting ceremonies instituted
in celebration of certain events, and then appealed
to the evidence in order to prove the events, Voltaire
makes a reflection which now seems very obvious, but
which these learned men had entirely overlooked. He
notices, that their labour is bootless, because the date of
the evidence is, with extremely few exceptions, much
later than the date of the event to which it refers.
In such cases, the existence of a festival, or of a monument,
proves, indeed, the belief which men entertain,
but by no means proves the reality of the occurrence
concerning which the belief is held.<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> This simple, but
important maxim, is, even in our own days, constantly
lost sight of, while before the eighteenth century it was
universally neglected. Hence it was that historians
were able to accumulate fables which were believed
without examination;<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> it being altogether forgotten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
that fables, as Voltaire says, begin to be current in one
generation, are established in the second, become respectable
in the third, while in the fourth generation
temples are raised in honour of them.<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a></p>

<p>I have been the more particular in stating the immense
obligations history is under to Voltaire, because in
England there exists against him a prejudice, which
nothing but ignorance, or something worse than ignorance,
can excuse;<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> and because, taking him on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
whole, he is probably the greatest historian Europe has
yet produced. In reference, however, to the mental
habits of the eighteenth century, it is important to show,
that in the same period similar comprehensiveness was
being displayed by other French historians; so that in
this case, as in all others, we shall find that a large
share of what is effected, even by the most eminent
men, is due to the character of the age in which they
live.</p>

<p>The vast labours of Voltaire towards reforming the
old method of writing history, were greatly aided by
those important works which Montesquieu put forward
during the same period. In 1734,<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> this remarkable
man published what may be truly called the first book
in which there can be found any information concerning
the real history of Rome; because it is also the first in
which the affairs of the ancient world are treated in a
large and comprehensive spirit.<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> Fourteen years later,
there appeared, by the same author, the <i>Spirit of Laws</i>;
a more famous production, but, as it seems to me, not a
greater one. The immense merit of the <i>Spirit of Laws</i>
is, indeed, incontestable, and cannot be affected by the
captious attempts made to diminish it by those minute
critics, who seem to think that when they detect the
occasional errors of a great man, they in some degree reduce
him to their own level. It is not such petty
cavilling which can destroy an European reputation;
and the noble work of Montesquieu will long survive all
attacks of this kind, because its large and suggestive
generalizations would retain their value even if the particular
facts of which the illustrations consist were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
unfounded.<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> Still, I am inclined to believe, that in
point of original thought it is barely equal to his earlier
work, though it is unquestionably the fruit of much
greater reading. Without, however, instituting a comparison
between them, our present object is merely to
consider the contributions they jointly contain towards
a right understanding of history, and the way in which
those contributions are connected with the general spirit
of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In this point of view, there are, in the works of Montesquieu,
two leading peculiarities. The first is, the
complete rejection of those personal anecdotes, and
those trivial details respecting individuals, which belong
to biography, but with which, as Montesquieu clearly
saw, history has no concern. The other peculiarity is,
the very remarkable attempt which he first made to
effect an union between the history of man and those
sciences which deal with the external world. As these
are the two great characteristics of the method adopted
by Montesquieu, it will be necessary to give some
account of them, before we can understand the place he
really occupies, as one of the founders of the philosophy
of history.</p>

<p>We have already seen that Voltaire had strongly insisted
on the necessity of reforming history, by paying
more attention to the history of the people, and less attention
to that of their political and military rulers.
We have also seen, that this great improvement was so
agreeable to the spirit of the time, that it was generally
and quickly adopted, and thus became an indication of
those democratic tendencies, of which it was in reality
a result. It is not, therefore, surprising that Montesquieu
should have taken the same course, even before
the movement had been clearly declared; since he, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
most great thinkers, was a representative of the intellectual
condition, and a satisfier of the intellectual
wants, of the age in which he lived.</p>

<p>But, what constitutes the peculiarity of Montesquieu
in this matter, is, that with him a contempt for those
details respecting courts, ministers, and princes, in which
ordinary compilers take great delight, was accompanied
by an equal contempt for other details which are really
interesting, because they concern the mental habits of
the few truly eminent men who, from time to time, have
appeared on the stage of public life. This was because
Montesquieu perceived that, though these things are
very interesting, they are also very unimportant. He
knew, what no historian before him had even suspected,
that in the great march of human affairs, individual
peculiarities count for nothing; and that, therefore, the
historian has no business with them, but should leave
them to the biographer, to whose province they properly
belong. The consequence is, that not only does he
treat the most powerful princes with such disregard as
to relate the reigns of six emperors in two lines,<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> but
he constantly enforces the necessity, even in the case of
eminent men, of subordinating their special influence to
the more general influence of the surrounding society.
Thus, many writers had ascribed the ruin of the Roman
Republic to the ambition of Cæsar and Pompey, and
particularly to the deep schemes of Cæsar. This, Montesquieu
totally denies. According to his view of history,
no great alteration can be effected, except by virtue of
a long train of antecedents, where alone we are to
seek the cause of what to a superficial eye is the work
of individuals. The republic, therefore, was overthrown,
not by Cæsar and Pompey, but by that state of things
which made the success of Cæsar and Pompey
possible.<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> It is thus that the events which ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
historians relate are utterly valueless. Such events, instead
of being causes, are merely the occasions on which
the real causes act.<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> They may be called the accidents
of history; and they must be treated as subservient to
those vast and comprehensive conditions, by which alone
the rise and fall of nations are ultimately governed.<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a></p>

<p>This, then, was the first great merit of Montesquieu,
that he effected a complete separation between biography
and history, and taught historians to study, not the pecularities
of individual character, but the general
aspect of the society in which the peculiarities appeared.
If this remarkable man had accomplished nothing further,
he would have rendered an incalculable service to
history, by pointing out how one of its most fertile
sources of error might be safely removed. And although,
unhappily, we have not yet reaped the full benefit of his
example, this is because his successors have really had
the capacity of rising to so high a generalization: it is,
however, certain, that since his time, an approximation
towards such elevated views may be noticed, even
among those inferior writers who, for want of sufficient
grasp, are unable to adopt them to their full extent.</p>

<p>In addition to this, Montesquieu made another great
advance in the method of treating history. He was the
first who, in an inquiry into the relations between the
social conditions of a country and its jurisprudence,
called in the aid of physical knowledge, in order to
ascertain how the character of any given civilization is
modified by the action of the external world. In his
work on the <i>Spirit of Laws</i>, he studies the way in which
both the civil and political legislation of a people are
naturally connected with their climate, soil, and food.<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
It is true, that in this vast enterprise he almost entirely
failed; but this was because meteorology, chemistry,
and physiology, were still too backward to admit of such
an undertaking. This, however, affects the value only
of his conclusions, not of his method; and here, as elsewhere,
we see the great thinker tracing the outline of a
plan, which, in the then state of knowledge, it was impossible
to fill up, and the completion of which he was
obliged to leave to the riper experience and more
powerful resources of a later age. Thus to anticipate
the march of the human intellect, and, as it were, forestal
its subsequent acquisitions, is the peculiar prerogative
of minds of the highest order; and it is this which
gives to the writings of Montesquieu a certain fragmentary
and provisional appearance, which was the necessary
consequence of a profoundly speculative genius dealing
with materials that were intractable, simply because
science had not yet reduced them to order by generalizing
the laws of their phenomena. Hence it is, that
many of the inferences drawn by Montesquieu are untenable;
such, for instance, as those regarding the effect
of diet in stimulating population by increasing the
fecundity of women,<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> and the effect of climate in
altering the proportion between the births of the
sexes.<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> In other cases, an increased acquaintance with
barbarous nations has sufficed to correct his conclusions,
particularly those concerning the effect which he supposed
climate to produce on individual character; for
we have now the most decisive evidence, that he was
wrong in asserting<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> that hot climates make people
unchaste and cowardly, while cold climates make them
virtuous and brave.</p>

<p>These, indeed, are comparatively trifling objections,
because, in all the highest branches of knowledge, the
main difficulty is, not to discover facts, but to discover
the true method according to which the laws of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
facts may be ascertained.<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> In this, Montesquieu performed
a double service, since he not only enriched
history, but also strengthened its foundation. He enriched
history by incorporating with it physical inquiries;
and he strengthened history by separating it from biography,
and thus freeing it from details which are
always unimportant, and often unauthentic. And
although he committed the error of studying the influence
of nature over men considered as individuals,<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a>
rather than over men considered as an aggregate society,
this arose principally from the fact that, in his time, the
resources necessary for the more complicated study had
not yet been created. Those resources, as I have shown,
are political economy and statistics; political economy
supplying the means of connecting the laws of physical
agents with the laws of the inequality of wealth, and,
therefore, with a great variety of social disturbances;
while statistics enable us to verify those laws in their
widest extent, and to prove how completely the volition
of individual men is controlled by their antecedents,
and by the circumstances in which they are placed. It
was, therefore, not only natural, but inevitable, that
Montesquieu should fail in his magnificent attempt to
unite the laws of the human mind with the laws of
external nature. He failed, partly because the sciences
of external nature were too backward, and partly because
those other branches of knowledge which connect
nature with men were still unformed. For, as to political
economy, it had no existence as a science until the
publication of the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> in 1776, twenty-one
years after the death of Montesquieu. As to
statistics, their philosophy is a still more recent creation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
since it is only during the last thirty years that they
have been systematically applied to social phenomena;
the earlier statisticians being merely a body of industrious
collectors, groping in the dark, bringing together
facts of every kind without selection or method, and
whose labours were consequently unavailable for those
important purposes to which they have been successfully
applied during the present generation.</p>

<p>Only two years after the publication of the <i>Spirit of
Laws</i>, Turgot delivered those celebrated lectures, of
which it has been said, that in them he created the
philosophy of history.<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> This praise is somewhat exaggerated;
for in the most important matters relating
to the philosophy of his subject, he takes the same view
as Montesquieu; and Montesquieu, besides preceding
him in point of time, was his superior certainly in
learning, perhaps in genius. Still, the merit of Turgot
is immense; and he belongs to that extremely small
class of men who have looked at history comprehensively,
and have recognized the almost boundless knowledge
needed for its investigation. In this respect, his method
is identical with that of Montesquieu, since both of these
great men excluded from their scheme the personal
details which ordinary historians accumulate, and concentrated
their attention upon those large general causes,
by the operation of which the destinies of nations are
permanently affected. Turgot clearly perceived, that,
notwithstanding the variety of events produced by the
play of human passions, there is amid this apparent
confusion a principle of order, and a regularity of march,
not to be mistaken by those whose grasp is firm enough
to seize the history of man as a complete and single
whole.<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> It is true that Turgot, subsequently engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
in political life, never possessed sufficient leisure to fill
up the splendid outline of what he so successfully
sketched: but though in the execution of his plan he
fell short of Montesquieu, still the analogy between the
two men is obvious, as also is their relation to the age
in which they lived. They, as well as Voltaire, were
the unconscious advocates of the democratic movement,
inasmuch as they discountenanced the homage which
historians had formerly paid to individuals, and rescued
history from being a mere recital of the deeds of political
and ecclesiastical rulers. At the same time, Turgot,
by the captivating prospects which he held out of future
progress,<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> and by the picture which he drew of the
capacity of society to improve itself, increased the impatience
which his countrymen were beginning to feel
against that despotic government, in whose presence
amelioration seemed to be hopeless. These, and similar
speculations, which now for the first time appeared in
French literature, stimulated the activity of the intellectual
classes, cheered them under the persecutions to
which they were exposed, and emboldened them to the
arduous enterprise of leading on the people to attack
the institutions of their native land. Thus it was, that
in France every thing tended to the same result. Every
thing indicated the approach of some sharp and terrible
struggle, in which the spirit of the present should war
with the spirit of the past; and in which it should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
finally settled, whether the people of France could free
themselves from the chains in which they had long been
held, or whether, missing their aim, they were doomed
to sink still lower in that ignominious vassalage, which
makes even the most splendid periods of their political
history a warning and a lesson to the civilized world.</p>

Europe; and on the former subservience of philosophy to theology,
compare <i>Hamilton's Discussions on Philosophy</i>, p. 197. But no one has
treated this subject so ably as M. Auguste Comte, in his great work,
<i>Philosophie Positive</i>. The service which the metaphysicians rendered to
the church by their development of the doctrine of transubstantiation
(<i>Blánco White's Evidence against Catholicism</i>, pp. 256&ndash;258) is a
striking instance of this subordination of the intellect to

that an increasing spirit of equality lessens the disposition to form

all events, it is certain that increasing knowledge has this effect; for
those great men whose turn of mind would formerly have made them
heretics, are now content to confine their innovations to other fields
of thought. If St. Augustin had lived in the seventeenth century, he
would have reformed or created the physical sciences. If Sir Isaac
Newton had lived in the fourth century, he would have organized a new
sect, and have troubled the church with his originality.</p></div>

History of the Variations of Protestant Churches. <i>Const. Hist.</i> vol. i.
p. 486: compare <i>Lerminier</i>, <i>Philos. du Droit</i>, vol. ii. p. 86.
Attempts have been made by Protestant theologians to retort against the
Catholics the arguments of Bossuet, on the ground that religious
variations are a necessary consequence of the honest pursuit of
religious truth. See <i>Blanco White's Evidence against Catholicism</i>, pp.
109&ndash;112; and his <i>Letters from Spain</i>, <i>by Doblado</i>, p. 127. With this I
fully agree; but it would be easy to show that the argument is fatal to
all ecclesiastical systems with strictly defined creeds, and, therefore,
strikes as heavily against the Protestant churches as against the
Catholic. Beausobre, in his acute and learned work on Manichæism, seems
to have felt this; and he makes the dangerous admission, &lsquo;que si
l'argument de M. de Meaux vaut quelque chose contre la Réformation, il a
la même force contre le Christianisme.&rsquo; <i>Hist. de Manichée</i>, vol. i. p.

Great Author (<i>Matthew</i> x. 6, and xv. 24), was merely to convert the
Jews; and if the doctrines of Christ had never extended beyond that
ignorant people, they could not have received those modifications which
philosophy imposed upon them. The whole of this subject is admirably
discussed in <i>Mackay's Progress of the Intellect in Religious
Development</i>, vol. ii. pp. 382 seq.; and on the &lsquo;universalism,&rsquo; first
clearly announced &lsquo;by the Hellenist Stephen,&rsquo; see p. 484. Neander makes
a noticeable attempt to evade the difficulty caused by the changes in
Christianity from &lsquo;various outward causes:&rsquo; see his <i>History of the

thinks that Cerinthus whose views are remarkable as being the point
where Gnosticism and Judaism touch each other, borrowed his system from
Alexandria. But this, though not unlikely, seems only to rest on the
authority of Theodoret. On the influence of the Platonism of Alexandria
in developing the idea of the Logos, see <i>Neander</i>, vol. ii. pp. 304,
306&ndash;314. Compare <i>Sharpe's Hist. of Egypt</i>, vol. ii. pp. 152 seq.</p></div>

deeply versed in the philosophy of Alexandria than were any of the other
fathers, Bossuet merely says, p. 98, &lsquo;à peu près dans le même temps, le
saint prêtre Clément Alexandrin déterra les antiquités du paganisme pour
le confondre.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_877_877" id="Footnote_877_877"></a><a href="#FNanchor_877_877"><span class="label">[877]</span></a> About the time that Bossuet wrote, a very learned writer
calculated that the area of the countries which professed Mohammedanism,
exceeded, by one fifth, those where Christianity was believed. See
<i>Brerewood's Inquiries touching the Diversity of Languages and
Religions</i>, Lond. 1674, pp. 144, 145. The estimate of Southey (<i>Vindiciæ
Ecclesiæ Anglicanæ</i>, London, 1826, p. 48), is very vague; but it is much
easier to judge of the extent of Mohammedan countries than of the extent
of their population. On this latter point we have the most conflicting
statements. In the nineteenth century, there are, according to Sharon
Turner (<i>Hist. of England</i>, vol. iii. p. 485, edit. 1839), eighty
million Mohammedans; according to Dr. Elliotson (<i>Human Physiology</i>, p.
1055, edit. 1840), more than a hundred and twenty-two million; while,
according to Mr. Wilkin (note in <i>Sir Thomas Browne's Works</i>, vol. ii.
p. 37, edit. 1835), there are a hundred and eighty-eight million.</p></div>

ideas regarding the Deity more lofty than those possessed by the
majority of Christians. The Koran contains noble passages on the oneness
of God; and for the views of their ordinary theologians, I may refer to
an interesting Mohammedan sermon, in <i>Transactions of the Bombay
Society</i>, vol. i. pp. 146&ndash;158. See also, in vol. iii. pp. 398&ndash;448, an
Essay by Vans Kennedy; and compare a remarkable passage, considering the
quarter from which it comes, in <i>Autobiography of the Emperor
Jehangueir</i>, p. 44. Those who are so thoughtless as to believe that
Mohammed was a hypocrite, had better study the admirable remarks of M.
Comte (<i>Philos. Pos.</i> vol. v. pp. 76, 77), who truly says, &lsquo;qu'un homme

historical principles; and if they are true, history is evidently
impossible to be written. On this account, though fully recognizing the

Comte, <i>Philos. Pos.</i> vol. iv. p. 280, vol. vi. pp. 316, 317.</p></div>

afterwards became somewhat ashamed of the praises he had bestowed on
Charles XII. In 1735, he writes to De Formont, &lsquo;si Charles XII
n'avait pas été excessivement grand, malheureux, et fou, je me serais
bien donné de garde de parler de lui.&rsquo; <i>&#338;uvres de Voltaire</i>, vol.
lvi. p. 462. In 1758, advancing still further, he says of Charles,
&lsquo;voilà, monsieur, ce que les hommes de tous les temps et de tous les
pays appellent un héros; mais c'est le vulgaire de tous les temps et de
tous les pays qui donne ce nom à la soif du carnage.&rsquo; <i>Ibid.</i>
vol. lx. p. 411. In 1759, he writes, that he was then engaged on the
history of Peter the Great: &lsquo;mais je doute que cela soit aussi amusant
que la vie de Charles XII; car ce Pierre n'était qu'un sage
extraordinaire, et Charles un fou extraordinaire, qui se battait, comme
Don Quichotte, contre des moulins à vent.&rsquo; Vol. lxi. p. 23: see also p.

progress Voltaire was making in his conception of what history ought to
be, and what its uses were.</p></div>

Condorcet, who says it was the only early prejudice which Voltaire was

observe, that Voltaire's earlier opinions were still more favourable to
Louis XIV. than those which he afterwards expressed in his history. See
a letter which he wrote in 1740 to Lord Harvey, printed in <i>&#338;uvres de

(<i>Vie de Voltaire</i>, p. 199) and Lord Brougham (<i>Men of Letters</i>, vol. i.

Voltaire superficial, that it may be well to observe, that his accuracy

the fact, unparalleled in literature, that he was equally great as a
dramatic writer and as an historian. Mr. Forster, in his admirable <i>Life
of Goldsmith</i>, 1854, says (vol. i. p. 119), &lsquo;Gray's high opinion of
Voltaire's tragedies is shared by one of our greatest authorities on
such a matter now living, Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, whom I have often

theatrical effects.&rsquo; Compare <i>Correspondence of Gray and Mason</i>, edit.

publication in 1818 of Hallam's Middle Ages, there was in the English
language no comprehensive account of the feudal system; unless, perhaps,
we except that given by Robertson, who in this, as in many other matters
of history, was a pupil of Voltaire. Not only Dalrymple, and writers of
his kind, but even Blackstone, took so narrow a view of this great
institution, that they were unable to connect it with the general state
of society to which it belonged. Some of our historians gravely traced
it back to Moses, in whose laws they found the origin of allodial lands.
See a charming passage in <i>Barry's History of the Orkney Islands</i>, p.

rites indécens peuvent être pratiqués par un peuple religieux avec une
grande pureté de c&oelig;ur. Mais quand l'incrédulité atteint ces peuples,
ces rites sont pour lui la cause et le prétexte de la plus révoltante
corruption.&rsquo; This passage is quoted by Mr. Milman, who calls it
&lsquo;extremely profound and just.&rsquo; <i>Milman's History of Christianity</i>, 1840,
vol. i. p. 28. And so it is&mdash;extremely profound and just. But it happens
that precisely the same remark was made by Voltaire, just about the time
that Constant was born. Speaking of the worship of Priapus, he says
(<i>Essai sur les M&oelig;urs</i>, chap. cxliii. in <i>&#338;uvres de Voltaire</i>, vol.
xvii. p. 341), &lsquo;nos idées de bienséance nous portent à croire qu'un
cérémonie qui nous paraît si infâme n'a été inventée que par la débauche;
mais il n'est guère croyable que la dépravation des m&oelig;urs ait jamais
chez aucun peuple établi des cérémonies religieuses. Il est probable, au
contraire, que cette coutume fut d'abord introduite dans les temps de
simplicité, et qu'on ne pensa d'abord qu'à honorer la Divinité dans le
symbole de la vie qu'elle nous a donnée. Une telle cérémonie a dû
inspirer la licence à la jeunesse, et paraître ridicule aux esprits
sages, dans les temps plus raffinés, plus corrompus, et plus éclairés.&rsquo;
Compare the remarks on the indecency of the Spartan customs, in
<i>Thirlwall's Hist. of Greece</i>, vol. i. pp. 326, 327.</p></div>

at the end of the seventeenth century; and yet they have, so far as I am
aware, escaped the attention of all the historians of political economy.
Indeed, on this, as on most matters, sufficient justice has not been
done to Voltaire, whose opinions were more accurate than those of
Quesnay and his followers. However, Mr. M'Culloch, in noticing one of
the economical errors of Voltaire, honestly admits that his &lsquo;opinions on
such subjects are, for the most part, very correct.&rsquo; <i>M'Culloch's
Principles of Political Economy</i>, p. 530. For proof of his sympathy with
Turgot's efforts to establish free trade, compare <i>Lettres inédites de

writings for his views on population; but this obligation has been too
strongly stated, as, indeed, is always the case when charges of
plagiarism are brought against great works. Still, Townsend is to be
considered as the precursor of Malthus; and if the reader is interested
in tracing the paternity of ideas, he will find some interesting
economical remarks in <i>Townsend's Journey through Spain</i>, vol. i. pp.
379, 383, vol. ii. pp. 85, 337, 387&ndash;393; which must be compared with
<i>M'Culloch's Literature of Political Economy</i>, pp. 259, 281&ndash;3. Voltaire
having preceded these authors, has, of course, fallen into errors which
they avoided; but nothing can be better than the way in which he opposes
the ignorant belief of his own time, that every thing should be done to
increase population. &lsquo;Le point principal n'est pas d'avoir du superflu
en hommes, mais de rendre ce que nous en avons le moins malheureux qu'il
est possible,&rsquo; is the summing-up of his able remarks, in <i>Dict.
Philos.</i>, article <i>Population</i>, sect. 2, in <i>&#338;uvres</i>, vol. xli. p.

English scholars has shown an appreciation of the beauties of his native
language; and many of them, such as Parr (in all his works) and Bentley
(in his mad edition of Milton), have done every thing in their power to
corrupt it. And there can be little doubt, that the principal reason why
well-educated women write and converse in a purer style than
well-educated men, is because they have not formed their taste according
to those ancient classical standards, which, admirable as they are in
themselves, should never be introduced into a state of society unfitted
for them. To this may be added, that Cobbett, the most racy and
idiomatic of all our writers, and Erskine, by far the greatest of our
forensic orators, knew little or nothing of any ancient language; and
the same observation applies to Shakespeare. On the supposed connexion
between the improvement of taste and the study of classical models,
there are some remarks worth attending to in <i>Rey's Théorie et Pratique

&lsquo;since the French Revolution, an indiscriminate abuse of this author has
been in England the test of orthodoxy and loyalty.&rsquo; <i>Campbell's Chief
Justices</i>, vol. ii. p. 335. Indeed, so extensively has the public mind
been prejudiced against this great man, that, until a very few years
ago, when Lord Brougham published a life of him, there was no book in
the English language containing even a tolerable account of one of the
most influential writers France has produced. This work of Lord
Brougham's, though a middling performance, is at least an honest one,
and, as it harmonizes with the general spirit of our time, it has
probably had considerable weight. In it he says of Voltaire, &lsquo;nor can
any one since the days of Luther be named, to whom the spirit of free
inquiry, nay, the emancipation of the human mind from spiritual tyranny,
owes a more lasting debt of gratitude.&rsquo; <i>Brougham's Life of Voltaire</i>,
p. 132. It is certain, that the better the history of the eighteenth
century is understood, the more the reputation of Voltaire will
increase; as was clearly foreseen by a celebrated writer nearly a
generation ago. In 1831, Lerminier wrote these remarkable, and, as the
result has proved, prophetic words: &lsquo;Il est temps de revenir à des
sentimens plus respectueux pour la mémoire de Voltaire&hellip;.
Voltaire a fait pour la France ce que Leibnitz a fait pour l'Allemagne;
pendant trois-quarts de siècle il a représenté son pays, puissant à la

Vico, whose genius was perhaps even more vast than that of Montesquieu,

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">PROXIMATE CAUSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AFTER THE
MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.</div>

<p>In the last chapter but one, I have attempted to ascertain
what those circumstances were which, almost
immediately after the death of Louis XIV., prepared
the way for the French Revolution. The result of the
inquiry has been, that the French intellect was stimulated
into activity by the examples and teachings of
England; and that this stimulus caused, or at all events
encouraged, a great breach between the government of
France and its literature;&mdash;a breach the more remarkable,
because during the reign of Louis XIV. the
literature, notwithstanding its temporary brilliancy, had
been invariably submissive, and had intimately allied
itself with the government, which was always ready to
reward its services. We have also seen that, this rupture
having arisen between the governing classes and
the intellectual classes, it followed, that the former, true
to their ancient instincts, began to chastise that spirit
of inquiry to which they were unaccustomed: hence
those persecutions which, with hardly a single exception,
were directed against every man of letters, and hence
too those systematic attempts to reduce literature to a
subserviency similar to that in which it had been held
under Louis XIV. It has, moreover, appeared, that the
great Frenchmen of the eighteenth century, though
smarting from the injuries constantly inflicted on them
by the government and the church, abstained from attacking
the government, but directed all their hostility
against the church. This apparent anomaly, of the
religious institutions being assailed, and the political
institutions being spared, has been shown to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
perfectly natural circumstance, arising out of the antecedents
of the French nation; and an attempt has been
made to explain what those antecedents were, and how
they acted. In the present chapter, I purpose to complete
this inquiry by examining the next great stage in the
history of the French mind. It was needful that, before
both church and state could fall, men should change the
ground of their hostility, and should attack political
abuses with the zeal they had hitherto reserved for religious
ones. The question, therefore, now arises, as to
the circumstances under which this change took place,
and the period when it actually occurred.</p>

<p>The circumstances which accompanied this great
change are, as we shall presently see, very complicated;
and, as they have never yet been studied in connexion
with each other, I shall, in the remaining part of this
volume, examine them at considerable length. On this
point it will, I think, be practicable to arrive at some
precise and well-defined results respecting the history of
the French Revolution. But the other point, namely,
the time at which the change took place, is not only
much more obscure, but by its nature will never admit
of complete precision. This, however, is a deficiency it
possesses in common with every other change in the
history of man. The circumstances of each change
may always be known, provided the evidence is ample
and authentic. But no amount of evidence can enable
us to fix the date of the change itself. That to which
attention is usually drawn by the compilers of history
is, not the change, but is merely the external result
which follows the change. The real history of the human
race is the history of tendencies which are perceived
by the mind, and not of events which are discerned by
the senses. It is on this account that no historical
epoch will ever admit of that chronological precision
familiar to antiquaries and genealogists. The death of
a prince, the loss of a battle, and the change of a dynasty,
are matters which fall entirely within the province
of the senses; and the moment in which they happen
can be recorded by the most ordinary observers. But
those great intellectual revolutions upon which all other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
revolutions are based, cannot be measured by so simple
a standard. To trace the movements of the human
mind, it is necessary to contemplate it under several
aspects, and then coördinate the results of what we
have separately studied. By this means we arrive at
certain general conclusions, which, like the ordinary
estimate of averages, increase in value in proportion as
we increase the number of instances from which they
are collected. That this is a safe and available method,
appears not only from the history of physical knowledge,<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a>
but also from the fact, that it is the basis of the empirical
maxims by which all men of sound understanding are
guided in those ordinary transactions of life to which
the generalizations of science have not yet been applied.
Indeed such maxims, which are highly valuable, and
which in their aggregate form what is called common
sense, are never collected with any thing like the precautions
that the philosophic historian ought to feel
himself bound to employ.</p>

<p>The real objection, therefore, to generalizations respecting
the development of the intellect of a nation is,
not that they want certainty, but that they lack precision.
This is just the point at which the historian
diverges from the annalist. That the English intellect,
for example, is gradually becoming more democratic, or,
as it is termed, more liberal, is as certain as that the
crown of this country is worn by Queen Victoria. But
though both these statements are equally certain, the
latter statement is more precise. We can tell the very
day on which the Queen ascended the throne; the
moment of her death will be known with equal precision;
and there can be no doubt that many other
particulars respecting her will be minutely and accurately
preserved. In tracing, however, the growth of English
liberalism, all such exactness deserts us. We can point
out the year in which the Reform Bill was passed; but
who can point out the year in which the Reform Bill
first became necessary? In the same way, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Jews will be admitted into parliament, is as certain as that
the Catholics have been admitted. Both these measures
are the inevitable result of that increasing indifference
to theological disputes, which must now be obvious to
every man who does not wilfully shut his eyes. But
while we know the hour in which the bill for Catholic
emancipation received the assent of the crown, there is
no one now living who can tell even the year in which
similar justice will be granted to the Jews. Both events
are equally certain, but both events are not equally
precise.</p>

<p>This distinction between certainty and precision I
have stated at some length, because it seems to be little
understood,<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> and because it is intimately connected with
the subject now before us. The fact of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
intellect having, during the eighteenth century, passed
through two totally distinct epochs, can be proved
by every description of evidence; but it is impossible
to ascertain the precise time when one epoch
succeeded the other. All that we can do is, to compare
the different indications which the history of that age
presents, and arrive at an approximation which may
guide future inquirers. It would perhaps be more prudent
to avoid making any particular statement; but as
the employment of dates seems necessary to bring such
matters clearly before the mind, I will, by way of provisional
hypothesis, fix on the year 1750, as the period
when those agitations of society which caused the
French Revolution entered into their second and political
stage.</p>

<p>That this was about the period when the great movement,
hitherto directed against the church, began to be
turned against the state, is an inference which many
circumstances seem to warrant. We know on the best
authority, that towards the year 1750, the French began
their celebrated inquiries respecting political economy,<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a>
and that, in their attempt to raise it to a science, they
were led to perceive the immense injury which the interference
of government had produced on the material
interests of the country.<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> Hence a conviction arose that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
even in regard to the accumulation of wealth, the authority
possessed by the rulers of France was mischievous,
since it enabled them, under the notion of protecting commerce,
to trouble the freedom of individual action, and to
prevent trade from running into those profitable channels
which traders are best able to select for themselves.
Scarcely had a knowledge of this important truth been
diffused, when its consequences were quickly seen in the
national literature, and in the habits of national thought.
The sudden increase in France of works relating to finance
and to other questions of government, is, indeed, one of
the most remarkable features of that age. With such
rapidity did the movement spread, that we are told that,
soon after 1755, the economists effected a schism between
the nation and the government;<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> and Voltaire, writing
in 1759, complains that the charms of lighter literature
were entirely neglected amidst the general zeal for
these new studies.<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> It is not necessary to follow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
subsequent history of this great change; nor need I
trace the influence exercised shortly before the Revolution
by the later economists, and particularly by Turgot,
the most eminent of their leaders.<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> It is enough to say,
that within about twenty years after the movement was
first clearly seen, the taste for economical and financial
inquiries became so common, that it penetrated those
parts of society where habits of thought are not very
frequent; since we find that, even in fashionable life,
the conversation no longer turned upon new poems
and new plays, but upon political questions, and subjects
immediately connected with them.<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> Indeed, when
Necker, in 1781, published his celebrated Report on the
Finances of France, the eagerness to obtain it was
beyond all bounds; six thousand copies were sold the
first day; and the demand still increasing, two presses
were kept constantly at work in order to satisfy the
universal curiosity.<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> And what makes the democratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
tendency of all this the more obvious is, that Necker
was at that time one of the servants of the crown; so
that his work, looking at its general spirit, has been
truly called an appeal to the people against the king by
one of the ministers of the king himself.<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a></p>

<p>This evidence of the remarkable change which, in or
about 1750, the French mind underwent, and which
formed what I term the second epoch of the eighteenth
century, might be easily strengthened by a wider survey
of the literature of that time. Immediately after the
middle of the century, Rousseau published those eloquent
works, which exercised immense influence, and in
which the rise of the new epoch is very observable; for
this most powerful writer abstained from those attacks
on Christianity,<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> which unhappily had been too frequent,
and exerted himself almost exclusively against the civil
and political abuses of the existing society.<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> To trace
the effects which this wonderful, but in some instances
misguided, man produced on the mind of his own and
of the succeeding generation, would occupy too large a
share of this Introduction; though the inquiry is full
of interest, and is one which it were to be wished some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
competent historian would undertake.<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> Inasmuch,
however, as the philosophy of Rousseau was itself only
a single phase of a far larger movement, I shall at present
pass over the individual, in order to consider the
general spirit of an age in which he played a vast, but
still a subsidiary part.</p>

<p>The formation of a new epoch in France, about the
year 1750, may be further illustrated by three circumstances
of considerable interest, all pointing in the same
direction. The first circumstance is, that not a single
great French writer attacked the political institutions
of the country before the middle of the century; while,
after that period, the attacks of the ablest men were
incessant. The second circumstance is, that the only
eminent Frenchmen who continued to assail the clergy,
and yet refused to interfere in politics, were those who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
like Voltaire, had already reached an advanced age, and
had, therefore, drawn their ideas from the preceding
generation, in which the church had been the sole object
of hostility. The third circumstance, which is even
more striking than the other two, is, that almost at the
same moment there was seen a change in the policy of
the government; since, singularly enough, the ministers
of the crown displayed for the first time an open enmity
against the church, just as the intellect of the country
was preparing for its decisive onslaught on the government
itself. Of these three propositions, the first two
will probably be admitted by every student of French
literature: at all events, if they are false, they are so
exact and peremptory, that it will be easy to refute them
by giving examples to the contrary. But the third
proposition, being more general, is less susceptible of a
negative, and will therefore require the support of that
special evidence which I will now adduce.</p>

<p>The great French writers having by the middle of the
eighteenth century succeeded in sapping the foundations
of the church, it was natural that the government
should step in and plunder an establishment which the
course of events had weakened. This, which took place
in France under Louis XV., was similar to what occurred
in England under Henry VIII.; for in both cases a
remarkable intellectual movement, directed against the
clergy, preceded and facilitated the attacks made on
them by the crown. It was in 1749 that the French
government took the first decisive step against the
church. And what proves the hitherto backward state
of the country in such matters is, that this consisted of
an edict against mortmain, a simple contrivance for
weakening the ecclesiastical power, which we in England
had adopted long before. Machault, who had recently
been raised to the office of controller-general, has the
glory of being the originator of this new policy. In
August 1749,<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> he issued that celebrated edict which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
forbade the formation of any religious establishment
without the consent of the crown, duly expressed in
letters-patent, and registered in parliament; effective
precautions, which, says the great historian of France,
show that Machault &lsquo;considered not only the increase,
but even the existence of these ecclesiastical properties,
as a mischief to the kingdom.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a></p>

<p>This was an extraordinary step on the part of the
French government; but what followed showed that it
was only the beginning of a much larger design.<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a>
Machault, so far from being discountenanced, was, the
year after he had issued this edict, intrusted with the
seals in addition to the controllership;<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> for, as Lacretelle
observes, the court &lsquo;thought the time had now
come to tax the property of the clergy.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> During the
forty years which elapsed between this period and the
beginning of the Revolution, the same anti-ecclesiastical
policy prevailed. Among the successors of Machault,
the only three of much ability were Choiseul, Necker,
and Turgot, all of whom were strenuous opponents of
that spiritual body, which no minister would have assailed
in the preceding generation. Not only these
eminent statesmen, but even such inferior men as
Calonne, Malesherbes, and Terray, looked on it as a
stroke of policy to attack privileges which superstition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
had consecrated, and which the clergy had hitherto
reserved, partly to extend their own influence, and
partly to minister to those luxurious and profligate
habits, which in the eighteenth century were a scandal
to the ecclesiastical order.</p>

<p>While these measures were being adopted against the
clergy, another important step was taken in precisely
the same direction. Now it was that the government
began to favour that great doctrine of religious liberty,
the mere defence of which it had hitherto punished as a
dangerous speculation. The connexion between the
attacks on the clergy and the subsequent progress of
toleration, may be illustrated, not only by the rapidity
with which one event succeeded the other, but also by
the fact, that both of them emanated from the same
quarter. Machault, who was the author of the edict of
mortmain, was also the first minister who showed a
wish to protect the Protestants against the persecutions
of the Catholic priesthood.<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> In this he only partly
succeeded; but the impetus thus given soon became
irresistible. In 1760, that is only nine years later,
there was seen a marked change in the administration
of the laws; and the edicts against heresy, though not
yet repealed, were enforced with unprecedented mildness.<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a>
The movement quickly spread from the capital
to the remoter parts of the kingdom; and we are assured
that, after the year 1762, the reaction was felt
even in those provinces, which, from their backward
condition, had always been most remarkable for religious
bigotry.<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> At the same time, as we shall presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
see, a great schism arose in the church itself, which
lessened the power of the clergy, by dividing them into
two hostile parties. Of these factions, one made
common cause with the state, still further aiding the
overthrow of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Indeed, the
dissensions became so violent, that the last great blow
dealt to spiritual ascendency by the government of
Louis XVI. proceeded not from the hands of a layman,
but from one of the leaders of the church; a man who,
from his standing, would, under ordinary circumstances,
have protected the interests which he now eagerly attacked.
In 1787, only two years before the Revolution,
Brienne, archbishop of Toulouse,<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> who was then minister,
laid before the parliament of Paris a royal edict,
by which the discouragement hitherto thrown upon
heresy was suddenly removed. By this law, the Protestants
were invested with all those civil rights which
the Catholic clergy had long held out as the reward of
adherence to their own opinions.<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> It was, therefore,
natural that the more orthodox party should condemn,
as an impious innovation,<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> a measure which, by placing
the two sects, in some degree, on the same footing,
seemed to sanction the progress of error; and which
certainly deprived the French church of one of the chief
attractions by which men had hitherto been induced to
join her communion. Now, however, all these considerations
were set at nought. Such was the prevailing
temper, that the parliament, though then in a mood
very refractory to the royal authority, did not hesitate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
to register the edict of the king; and this great measure
became law; the dominant party being astonished, we
are told, how any doubt could be entertained as to the
wisdom of the principles on which it was based.<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a></p>

<p>These were omens of the coming storm; signs of the
time, which those who run may read. Nor are there
wanting other marks, by which the true complexion of
that age may be clearly seen. In addition to what has
been just related, the government, soon after the middle
of the eighteenth century, inflicted a direct and fatal
injury upon the spiritual authority. This consisted in
the expulsion of the Jesuits; which is an event, important
not only for its ultimate effects, but also as an
evidence of the feelings of men, and of what could be
peaceably accomplished by the government of him who
was called &lsquo;the most Christian king.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a></p>

<p>The Jesuits, for at least fifty years after their institution,
rendered immense services to civilization, partly
by tempering with a secular element the more superstitious
views of their great predecessors, the Dominicans
and Franciscans, and partly by organizing a system
of education far superior to any yet seen in Europe. In
no university could there be found a scheme of instruction
so comprehensive as theirs; and certainly no where
was displayed such skill in the management of youth,
or such insight into the general operations of the
human mind. It must, in justice, be added, that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
illustrious society, notwithstanding its eager, and often
unprincipled, ambition, was, during a considerable period,
the steady friend of science, as well as of literature; and
that it allowed to its members a freedom and a boldness
of speculation which had never been permitted by any
other monastic order.</p>

<p>As, however, civilization advanced, the Jesuits, like
every spiritual hierarchy the world has yet seen, began
to lose ground; and this not so much from their own
decay, as from a change in the spirit of those who surrounded
them. An institution admirably adapted to an
early form of society, was ill suited to the same society
in its maturer state. In the sixteenth century, the
Jesuits were before their age; in the eighteenth century,
they were behind it. In the sixteenth century, they
were the great missionaries of knowledge; because they
believed that, by its aid, they could subjugate the consciences
of men. But, in the eighteenth century, their
materials were more refractory; they had to deal with
a perverse and stiff-necked generation; they saw in
every country the ecclesiastical authority rapidly declining;
and they clearly perceived that their only
chance of retaining their old dominion was, by checking
that knowledge, the progress of which they had formerly
done much to accelerate.<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a></p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the statesmen of France,
almost immediately after the middle of the eighteenth
century, determined to ruin an order which had long
ruled the world, and which was still the greatest bulwark
of the church. In this design they were aided by
a curious movement which had taken place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
church itself, and which, being connected with views of
much wider import, deserves the attention even of those
for whom theological controversies have no interest.</p>

<p>Among the many points on which metaphysicians
have wasted their strength, that of free-will has provoked
the hottest disputes. And what has increased
the acerbity of their language, is, that this, which is
eminently a metaphysical question, has been taken up
by theologians, who have treated it with that warmth
for which they are remarkable.<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> From the time of
Pelagius, if not earlier,<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> Christianity has been divided
into two great sects, which, though in some respects
uniting by insensible shades, have always preserved the
broad features of their original difference. By one sect,
the freedom of the will is virtually, and often expressly,
denied; for it is asserted, not only that we cannot of
our own will effect anything meritorious, but that whatever
good we may do will be useless, since the Deity
has predestined some men to perdition, others to salvation.
By the other sect, the freedom of the will is as
strongly upheld; good works are declared essential to
salvation; and the opposite party is accused of exaggerating
that state of grace of which faith is a necessary
accompaniment.<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a></p>

<p>These opposite principles, when pushed to their
logical consequences, must lead the first sect into antinomianism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a>
and the second sect into the doctrine of
supererogatory works.<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> But since on such subjects,
men feel far more than they reason, it usually happens
that they prefer following some common and accredited
standard, or appealing to some ancient name:<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> and
they, therefore, generally class themselves on the one
side under Augustin, Calvin, and Jansenius; on the
other side under Pelagius, Arminius, and Molina.</p>

<p>Now, it is an interesting fact, that the doctrines
which in England are called Calvinistic, have been
always connected with a democratic spirit; while those
of Arminianism have found most favour among the
aristocratic or protective party. In the republics of
Switzerland, of North America, and of Holland, Calvinism
was always the popular creed.<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> On the other
hand, in those evil days, immediately after the death of
Elizabeth, when our liberties were in imminent peril;
when the Church of England, aided by the crown,
attempted to subjugate the consciences of men; and
when the monstrous claim of the divine right of episcopacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
was first put forward;<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a>&mdash;then it was that Arminianism
became the cherished doctrine of the ablest and
most ambitious of the ecclesiastical party.<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> And in
that sharp retribution which followed, the Puritans and
Independents, by whom the punishment was inflicted,
were, with scarcely an exception, Calvinists:<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> nor
should we forget, that the first open movement against
Charles proceeded from Scotland, where the principles
of Calvin had long been in the ascendant.</p>

<p>This different tendency of these two creeds is so
clearly marked, that an inquiry into its causes becomes
a necessary part of general history, and as we shall
presently see, is intimately connected with the history
of the French Revolution.</p>

<p>The first circumstance by which we must be struck
is, that Calvinism is a doctrine for the poor, and Arminianism
for the rich. A creed which insists upon the
necessity of faith, must be less costly than one which
insists upon the necessity of works. In the former case,
the sinner seeks salvation by the strength of his belief;
in the latter case, he seeks it by the fullness of his contributions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
And as those contributions, wherever the
clergy have much power, always flow in the same direction,
we find that in countries which favour the Arminian
doctrine of works, the priests are better paid, and
the churches more richly ornamented, than they are
where Calvinism has the upper hand. Indeed it is
evident to the most vulgar calculation, that a religion
which concentrates our charity upon ourselves, is less
expensive than one which directs our charity to others.</p>

<p>This is the first great practical divergence of the two
creeds: a divergence which may be verified by any one
who is acquainted with the histories of different Christian
nations, or who has even travelled in countries where
the different tenets are professed. It is also observable,
that the Church of Rome, whose worship is addressed
mainly to the senses, and who delights in splendid
cathedrals and pompous ceremonies, has always displayed
against the Calvinists an animosity far greater
than she has done against any other Protestant sect.<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a></p>

<p>Out of these circumstances, inevitably arose the aristocratic
tendency of Arminianism, and the democratic
tendency of Calvinism. The people love pomp and
pageantry as much as the nobles do, but they do not
love to pay for them. Their untutored minds are easily
captivated by the array of a numerous priesthood, and
by the gorgeousness of a well-appointed temple. Still,
they know full well that these things absorb a large part
of that wealth which would otherwise flow into their
own cottages. On the other hand, the aristocracy, by
their standing, their habits, and the traditions of their
education, naturally contract a taste for expense, which
makes them unite splendour with religion, and connect
pomp with piety. Besides this, they have an intuitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
and well-founded belief that their own interests are
associated with the interests of the priesthood, and that
whatever weakens the one will hasten the downfall of
the other. Hence it is, that every Christian democracy
has simplified its external worship; every Christian
aristocracy has embellished it. By a parity of reasoning,
the more any society tends to equality, the more
likely it is that its theological opinions will be Calvinistic;
while the more a society tends towards inequality,
the greater the probability of those opinions being
Arminian.</p>

<p>It would be easy to push this contrast still further,
and to show that Calvinism is more favourable to the
sciences, Arminianism to the arts;<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> and that, on the
same principle, the first is better suited to thinkers, the
other to scholars.<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> But without pretending to trace
the whole of this divergence, it is very important to
observe, that the professors of the former religion are
more likely to acquire habits of independent thinking
than those of the latter. And this on two distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
grounds. In the first place, even the most ordinary of
the Calvinistic party are, by the very terms of their
creed, led, in religious matters, to fix their attention on
their own minds rather than on the minds of others.
They, therefore, as a body, are intellectually more narrow
than their opponents, but less servile; their views,
though generalized from a smaller field, are more independent;
they are less attached to antiquity, and more
heedless of those traditions to which the Arminian scholars
attach great importance. In the second place, those
who associate metaphysics with their religion are led
by Calvinism into the doctrine of necessity;<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> a theory
which, though often misunderstood, is pregnant with
great truths, and is better calculated than any other
system to develop the intellect, because it involves
that clear conception of law, the attainment of which is
the highest point the human understanding can reach.</p>

<p>These considerations will enable the reader to see
the immense importance of that revival of Jansenism,
which took place in the French church during the
eighteenth century. For, Jansenism being essentially
Calvinistic,<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> those tendencies appeared in France by
which Calvinism is marked. There appeared the inquisitive,
democratic, and insubordinate spirit, which has
always accompanied that creed. A further confirmation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
of the truth of the principles just laid down is, that
Jansenism originated with a native of the Dutch Republic;<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a>
that it was introduced into France during the
glimpse of freedom which preceded the power of Louis
XIV.;<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> that it was forcibly repressed in his arbitrary
reign;<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> and that before the middle of the eighteenth
century, it again arose, as the natural product of a state
of society by which the French Revolution was brought
about.</p>

<p>The connexion between the revival of Jansenism and
the destruction of the Jesuits, is obvious. After the
death of Louis XIV., the Jansenists rapidly gained
ground, even in the Sorbonne;<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> and by the middle of
the eighteenth century, they had organized a powerful
party in the French parliament.<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> About the same
period, their influence began to show itself in the executive
government, and among the officers of the
crown. Machault, who held the important post of controller-general,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
was known to favour their opinions;<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a>
and a few years after his retirement, Choiseul was called
to the head of affairs; a man of considerable ability,
by whom they were openly protected.<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> Their views
were likewise supported by Laverdy, controller-general
in 1764, and by Terray, controller of finances in 1769.<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a>
The procureur-general, Gilbert des Voisins, was a Jansenist;<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a>
so also was one of his successors, Chauvelin;<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a>
and so was the advocate-general Pelletier de Saint-Fargeau;<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a>
and so too was Camus, the well-known
advocate of the clergy.<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> Turgot, the greatest statesman
of the age, is said to have embraced the same
opinions;<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> while Necker, who on two different occasions
possessed almost supreme power, was notoriously
a rigid Calvinist. To this may be added, that not only
Necker, but also Rousseau, to whom a large share in
causing the Revolution is justly ascribed, were born in
Geneva, and drew their earliest ideas from that great
nursery of the Calvinistic theology.</p>

<p>In such a state of things as this, it was impossible
that a body like the Jesuits should hold their ground.
They were the last defenders of authority and tradition,
and it was natural that they should fall in an age when
statesmen were sceptics, and theologians were Calvinists.
Even the people had already marked them for destruction;
and when Damiens, in 1757, attempted to assassinate
the king, it was generally believed that they were
the instigators of the act.<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> This we now know to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
false; but the existence of such a rumour is evidence
of the state of the popular mind. At all events, the
doom of the Jesuits was fixed. In April 1761, parliament
ordered their constitutions to be laid before them.<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a>
In August, they were forbidden to receive novices, their
colleges were closed, and a number of their most celebrated
works were publicly burned by the common
hangman.<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> Finally, in 1762, another edict appeared,
by which the Jesuits were condemned without even
being heard in their own defence;<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> their property was
directed to be sold, and their order secularized; they
were declared &lsquo;unfit to be admitted into a well-governed
country,&rsquo; and their institute and society were formally
abolished.<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a></p>

<p>Such was the way in which this great society, long
the terror of the world, fell before the pressure of public
opinion. What makes its fall the more remarkable, is,
that the pretext which was alleged to justify the examination
of its constitutions, was one so slight, that no
former government would have listened to it for a single
moment. This immense spiritual corporation was
actually tried by a temporal court for ill faith in a
mercantile transaction, and for refusing to pay a sum of
money said to be due!<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> The most important body in
the Catholic church, the spiritual leaders of France,
the educators of her youth, and the confessors of her
kings, were brought to the bar, and sued in their collective
capacity, for the fraudulent repudiation of a
common debt!<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> So marked was the predisposition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
affairs, that it was not found necessary to employ for the
destruction of the Jesuits any of those arts by which
the popular mind is commonly inflamed. The charge
upon which they were sentenced, was not that they had
plotted against the state; nor that they had corrupted
the public morals; nor that they wished to subvert
religion. These were the accusations which were
brought in the seventeenth century, and which suited
the genius of that age. But in the eighteenth century,
all that was required was some trifling accident, that
might serve as a pretence to justify what the nation had
already determined. To ascribe, therefore, this great
event to the bankruptcy of a trader, or the intrigues of
a mistress,<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> is to confuse the cause of an act with the
pretext under which the act is committed. In the eyes
of the men of the eighteenth century, the real crime of
the Jesuits was, that they belonged to the past rather
than to the present, and that by defending the abuses
of ancient establishments, they obstructed the progress
of mankind. They stood in the way of the age, and the
age swept them from its path. This was the real cause
of their abolition: a cause not likely to be perceived by
those writers, who, under the guise of historians, are
only collectors of the prattle and gossip of courts; and
who believe that the destinies of great nations can be
settled in the ante-chambers of ministers, and in the
councils of kings.</p>

<p>After the fall of the Jesuits, there seemed to be
nothing remaining which could save the French church
from immediate destruction.<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> The old theological spirit
had been for some time declining, and the clergy were
suffering from their own decay even more than from the
attacks made upon them. The advance of knowledge
was producing in France the same results as those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
which I have pointed out in England; and the increasing
attractions of science drew off many illustrious men,
who in a preceding age would have been active members
of the spiritual profession. That splendid eloquence,
for which the French clergy had been remarkable, was
now dying away, and there were no longer heard the
voices of those great orators, at whose bidding the
temples had formerly been filled.<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> Massillon was the last
of that celebrated race who had so enthralled the mind,
and the magic of whose fascination it is even now hard
to withstand. He died in 1742; and after him the
French clergy possessed no eminent men of any kind,
neither thinkers, nor orators, nor writers.<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> Nor did
there seem the least possibility of their recovering their
lost position. While society was advancing they were
receding. All the sources of their power were dried up.
They had no active leaders; they had lost the confidence
of government; they had forfeited the respect of the
people; they had become a mark for the gibes of the
age.<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a></p>

<p>It does, at first sight, seem strange that, under these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
circumstances, the French clergy should have been able,
for nearly thirty years after the abolition of the Jesuits,
to maintain their standing, so as to interfere with impunity
in public affairs.<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> The truth, however, is, that
this temporary reprieve of the ecclesiastical order was
owing to that movement which I have already noticed,
and by virtue of which the French intellect, during the
latter half of the eighteenth century, changed the ground
of its attack, and, directing its energies against political
abuses, neglected in some degree those spiritual
abuses to which its attention had been hitherto confined.
The result was, that in France the government enforced
a policy which the great thinkers had indeed originated,
but respecting which they were becoming less eager.
The most eminent Frenchmen were beginning their
attacks upon the state, and in the heat of their new
warfare they slackened their opposition to the church.
But in the mean time, the seeds they had sown germinated
in the state itself. So rapid was the march of
affairs, that those anti-ecclesiastical opinions which,
a few years earlier, were punished as the paradoxes of
designing men, were now taken up and put into execution
by senators and ministers. The rulers of France
carried into effect principles which had hitherto been
simply a matter of theory; and thus it happened, as is
always the case, that practical statesmen only apply and
work out ideas which have long before been suggested
by more advanced thinkers.</p>

<p>Hence it followed, that at no period during the eighteenth
century did the speculative classes and practical
classes thoroughly combine against the church: since,
in the first half of the century, the clergy were principally
assailed by the literature, and not by the
government; in the latter half of the century, by the
government, and not by the literature. Some of the
circumstances of this singular transition have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
already stated, and I hope clearly brought before the
mind of the reader. I now purpose to complete the
generalization, by proving that a corresponding change
was taking place in all other branches of inquiry; and
that, while in the first period attention was chiefly
directed towards mental phenomena, it was in the second
period more directed towards physical phenomena.
From this, the political movement received a vast accession
of strength. For the French intellect, shifting
the scene of its labours, diverted the thoughts of men
from the internal to the external, and concentrating
attention upon their material rather than upon their
spiritual wants, turned against the encroachments of
the state an hostility formerly reserved for the encroachments
of the church. Whenever a tendency arises to
prefer what comes from without to what comes from
within, and thus to aggrandize matter at the expense of
mind, there will also be a tendency to believe that an
institution which hampers our opinions is less hurtful
than one which controls our acts. Precisely in the same
way, men who reject the fundamental truths of religion,
will care little for the extent to which those truths are
perverted. Men who deny the existence of the Deity
and the immortality of the soul, will take no heed of
the way in which a gross and formal worship obscures
those sublime doctrines. All the idolatry, all the ceremonials,
all the pomp, all the dogmas, and all the
traditions by which religion is retarded, will give them
no disquietude, because they consider the opinions that
are checked to be equally false with those that are
favoured. Why should they, to whom transcendental
truths are unknown, labour to remove the superstitions
which darken the truths? Such a generation, so far
from attacking ecclesiastical usurpations, would rather
look on the clergy as convenient tools to ensnare the
ignorant and control the vulgar. Therefore it is that
we rarely hear of a sincere atheist being a zealous
polemic. But if that should occur, which a century
ago occurred in France; if it should happen that men
of great energy, and actuated by the feelings I have
described, were to find themselves in the presence of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
political despotism,&mdash;they would direct against it the
whole of their powers; and they would act with the
more determined vigour, because, believing that their
all was at stake, temporal happiness would be to them
not only the first, but also the sole consideration.</p>

<p>It is from this point of view that the progress of those
atheistical opinions, which now rose in France, becomes
a matter of great though painful interest. And the
date at which they appeared, fully corroborates what I
have just said respecting the change that took place in
the middle of the eighteenth century. The first great
work in which they were openly promulgated, was the
celebrated Encyclopædia, published in 1751.<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> Before
that time such degrading opinions, though occasionally
broached, were not held by any men of ability; nor
could they in the preceding state of society have made
much impression upon the age. But during the latter
half of the eighteenth century, they affected every department
of French literature. Between 1758 and
1770, atheistical tenets rapidly gained ground;<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> and in
1770 was published the famous work, called the <i>System
of Nature</i>; the success, and, unhappily, the ability of
which, makes its appearance an important epoch in the
history of France. Its popularity was immense;<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
the views it contains are so clearly and methodically
arranged, as to have earned for it the name of the code
of atheism.<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> Five years later, the Archbishop of Toulouse,
in a formal address to the king on behalf of the
clergy, declared that atheism had now become the prevailing
opinion.<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> This, like all similar assertions, must
have been an exaggeration; but that there was a large
amount of truth in it, is known to whoever has studied
the mental habits of the generation immediately preceding
the Revolution. Among the inferior class of
writers, Damilaville, Deleyre, Maréchal, Naigeon, Toussaint,
were active supporters of that cold and gloomy
dogma, which, in order to extinguish the hope of a
future life, blots out from the mind of man the glorious
instincts of his own immortality.<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> And, strange to say,
several even of the higher intellects were unable to
escape the contagion. Atheism was openly advocated
by Condorcet, by D'Alembert, by Diderot, by Helvétius,
by Lalande, by Laplace, by Mirabeau, and by Saint
Lambert.<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> Indeed, so thoroughly did all this harmonize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
with the general temper, that in society men
boasted of what, in other countries, and in other days,
has been a rare and singular error, an eccentric taint,
which those affected by it were willing to conceal. In
1764 Hume met, at the house of Baron d'Holbach, a
party of the most celebrated Frenchmen then residing
in Paris. The great Scotchman, who was no doubt
aware of the prevailing opinion, took occasion to raise
an argument as to the existence of an atheist, properly
so called; for his own part, he said, he had never
chanced to meet with one. &lsquo;You have been somewhat
unfortunate,&rsquo; replied Holbach; &lsquo;but at the present
moment you are sitting at table with seventeen of
them.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a></p>

<p>This, sad as it is, only forms a single aspect of that
immense movement, by which, during the latter half of
the eighteenth century, the French intellect was withdrawn
from the study of the internal, and concentrated
upon that of the external world. Of this tendency, we
find an interesting instance in the celebrated work of
Helvétius, unquestionably the ablest and most influential
treatise on morals which France produced at this period.
It was published in 1758;<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> and, although it bears the
title of an essay on &lsquo;the Mind,&rsquo; it does not contain a
single passage from which we could infer that the mind,
in the sense in which the word is commonly used, has
any existence. In this work, which, during fifty years,
was the code of French morals, principles are laid down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
which bear exactly the same relation to ethics that
atheism bears to theology. Helvétius, at the beginning
of his inquiry, assumes, as an incontestable fact, that the
difference between man and other animals is the result
of a difference in their external form; and that if, for
example, our wrists, instead of ending with hands and
flexible fingers, had merely ended like a horse's foot, we
should have always remained wanderers on the face of
the earth, ignorant of every art, entirely defenceless,
and having no other concern but to avoid the attacks of
wild beasts, and find the needful supply of our daily
food.<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> That the structure of our bodies is the sole
cause of our boasted superiority, becomes evident, when
we consider that our thoughts are simply the product of
two faculties, which we have in common with all other
animals; namely, the faculty of receiving impressions
from external objects, and the faculty of remembering
those impressions after they are received.<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> From
this, says Helvétius, it follows, that the internal powers
of man being the same as those of all other animals,
our sensibility and our memory would be useless, if it
were not for those external peculiarities by which we
are eminently distinguished, and to which we owe every
thing that is most valuable.<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> These positions being
laid down, it is easy to deduce all the essential principles
of moral actions. For, memory being merely one
of the organs of physical sensibility,<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> and judgment
being only a sensation,<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> all notions of duty and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
virtue must be tested by their relation to the senses; in
other words, by the gross amount of physical enjoyment
to which they give rise. This is the true basis of moral
philosophy. To take any other view, is to allow ourselves
to be deceived by conventional expressions, which
have no foundation except in the prejudices of ignorant
men. Our vices and our virtues are solely the result of
our passions; and our passions are caused by our physical
sensibility to pain and to pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> It was in this
way that the sense of justice first arose. To physical
sensibility men owe pleasure and pain; hence the feeling
of their own interests, and hence the desire of living
together in societies. Being assembled in society, there
grew up the notion of a general interest, since, without
it, society could not hold together; and, as actions are
only just or unjust in proportion as they minister to
this general interest, a measure was established, by
which justice is discriminated from injustice.<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a> With
the same inflexible spirit, and with great fullness of
illustration, Helvétius examines the origin of those
other feelings which regulate human actions. Thus,
he says that both ambition and friendship are entirely
the work of physical sensibility. Men yearn after fame,
on account either of the pleasure which they expect the
mere possession of it will give, or else as the means of
subsequently procuring other pleasures.<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> As to friendship,
the only use of it is to increase our pleasures or
mitigate our pains; and it is with this object that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
man longs to hold communion with his friend.<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> Beyond
this, life has nothing to offer. To love what is good
for the sake of the goodness, is as impossible as to love
what is bad for the sake of the evil.<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> The mother who
weeps for the loss of her child, is solely actuated by
selfishness; she mourns because a pleasure is taken
from her, and because she sees a void difficult to fill
up.<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> So it is, that the loftiest virtues, as well as the
meanest vices, are equally caused by the pleasure we
find in the exercise of them.<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> This is the great mover
and originator of all. Every thing that we have, and
every thing that we are, we owe to the external world;
nor is Man himself aught else except what he is made
by the objects which surround him.<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a></p>

<p>The views put forward in this celebrated work I have
stated at some length; not so much on account of the
ability with which they are advocated, as on account of
the clue they furnish to the movements of a most remarkable
age. Indeed, so completely did they harmonize
with the prevailing tendencies, that they not only
quickly obtained for their author a vast European
reputation,<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> but, during many years, they continued to
increase in influence, and, in France in particular, they
exercised great sway.<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> As that was the country in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
which they arose, so also was it the country to which
they were best adapted. Madame Dudeffand, who passed
her long life in the midst of French society, and was
one of the keenest observers of her time, has expressed
this with great happiness. The work of Helvétius, she
says, is popular, since he is the man who has told to all
their own secret.<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a></p>

<p>True it was, that, to the contemporaries of Helvétius,
his views, notwithstanding their immense popularity,
bore the appearance of a secret; because the connexion
between them and the general march of events was, as
yet, but dimly perceived. To us, however, who, after
this interval of time, can examine the question with the
resources of a larger experience, it is obvious how such
a system met the wants of an age of which it was the
exponent and the mouthpiece. That Helvétius must
have carried with him the sympathies of his countrymen,
is clear, not only from the evidence we have of his
success, but also from a more comprehensive view of
the general complexion of those times. Even while he
was still pursuing his labours, and only four years
before he published them, a work appeared in France,
which, though displaying greater ability, and possessing
a higher influence than that of Helvétius, did, nevertheless,
point in exactly the same direction. I allude to
the great metaphysical treatise by Condillac, in many
respects one of the most remarkable productions of the
eighteenth century; and the authority of which, during
two generations, was so irresistible, that, without some
acquaintance with it, we cannot possibly understand
the nature of those complicated movements by which
the French Revolution was brought about.</p>

<p>In 1754,<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> Condillac put forth his celebrated work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
on the mind; the very title of which was a proof of the
bias with which it was written. Although this profound
thinker aimed at nothing less than an exhaustive
analysis of the human faculties, and although he is pronounced
by a very able, but hostile critic, to be the only
metaphysician France produced during the eighteenth
century,<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> still he found it utterly impossible to escape
from those tendencies towards the external which
governed his own age. The consequence was, that he
called his work a &lsquo;Treatise on Sensations;&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> and in it
he peremptorily asserts, that every thing we know is
the result of sensation; by which he means the effect
produced on us by the action of the external world.
Whatever may be thought of the accuracy of this
opinion, there can be no doubt that it is enforced with a
closeness and severity of reasoning which deserves the
highest praise. To examine, however, the arguments
by which his view is supported, would lead to a discussion
foreign to my present object, which is, merely
to point out the relation between his philosophy and the
general temper of his contemporaries. Without, therefore,
pretending to anything like a critical examination
of this celebrated book, I will simply bring together the
essential positions on which it is based, in order to
illustrate the harmony between it and the intellectual
habits of the age in which it appeared.<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a></p>

<p>The materials from which the philosophy of Condillac
was originally drawn, were contained in the great work
published by Locke about sixty years before this time.
But though much of what was most essential was
borrowed from the English philosopher, there was one
very important point in which the disciple differed from
his master. And this difference is strikingly characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
of the direction which the French intellect was
now taking. Locke, with some looseness of expression,
and possibly with some looseness of thought, had asserted
the separate existence of a power of reflection,
and had maintained that by means of that power the
products of sensation became available.<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> Condillac,
moved by the prevailing temper of his own time, would
not hear of such a distinction. He, like most of his
contemporaries, was jealous of any claim which increased
the authority of the internal, and weakened
that of the external. He, therefore, altogether rejects
the faculty of reflection as a source of our ideas; and
this partly because it is but the channel through which
ideas run from the senses, and partly because in its
origin it is itself a sensation.<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> Therefore, according to
him, the only question is as to the way in which our
contact with nature supplies us with ideas. For in this
scheme, the faculties of man are solely caused by the
operation of his senses. The judgments which we form
are, says Condillac, often ascribed to the hand of the
Deity; a convenient mode of reasoning, which has only
arisen from the difficulty of analyzing them.<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> By
considering how our judgments actually arise, we can
alone remove these obscurities. The fact is, that
the attention we give to an object is nothing but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
sensation which that object excites;<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> and what we call
abstract ideas are merely different ways of being attentive.<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a>
Ideas being thus generated, the subsequent
process is very simple. To attend to two ideas at the
same time, is to compare them; so that comparison is
not a result of attention, but is rather the attention itself.<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a>
This at once gives us the faculty of judging,
because directly we institute a comparison, we do of
necessity form a judgment.<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> Thus, too, memory is a
transformed sensation;<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> while the imagination is
nothing but memory, which, being carried to its highest
possible vivacity, makes what is absent appear to be
present.<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> The impressions we receive from the external
world being, therefore, not the cause of our
faculties, but being the faculties themselves, the conclusion
to which we are driven is inevitable. It follows,
says Condillac, that in man nature is the beginning of
all; that to nature we owe the whole of our knowledge;
that we only instruct ourselves according to her lessons;
and that the entire art of reasoning consists in continuing
the work which she has appointed us to perform.<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a></p>

<p>It is so impossible to mistake the tendency of these
views, that I need not attempt to estimate their result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
otherwise than by measuring the extent to which they
were adopted. Indeed, the zeal with which they were
now carried into every department of knowledge, can
only surprise those who, being led by their habits of
mind to study history in its separate fragments, have not
accustomed themselves to consider it as an united whole,
and who, therefore, do not perceive that in every great
epoch there is some one idea at work, which is more
powerful than any other, and which shapes the events of
the time and determines their ultimate issue. In France,
during the latter half of the eighteenth century, this
idea was, the inferiority of the internal to the external.
It was this dangerous but plausible principle which
drew the attention of men from the church to the state;
which was seen in Helvétius the most celebrated of the
French moralists, and in Condillac the most celebrated
of the French metaphysicians. It was this same
principle which, by increasing, if I may so say, the
reputation of Nature, induced the ablest thinkers to
devote themselves to a study of her laws, and to
abandon those other pursuits which had been popular in
the preceding age. In consequence of this movement,
such wonderful additions were made to every branch of
physical science, that more new truths concerning the
external world were discovered in France during the
latter half of the eighteenth century than during all the
previous periods put together. The details of these
discoveries, so far as they have been subservient to the
general purposes of civilization, will be related in
another place; at present I will indicate only the most
prominent, in order that the reader may understand the
course of the subsequent argument, and may see the
connexion between them and the French Revolution.</p>

<p>Taking a general view of the external world, we may
say, that the three most important forces by which the
operations of nature are effected, are heat, light, and
electricity; including under this last magnetic and
galvanic phenomena. On all these subjects, the French,
for the first time, now exerted themselves with signal
success. In regard to heat, not only were the materials
for subsequent induction collected with indefatigable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
industry, but before that generation passed away, the
induction was actually made; for while the laws of its
radiation were worked out by Prevost,<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> those of its
conduction were established by Fourier, who, just before
the Revolution, employed himself in raising thermotics
to a science by the deductive application of that celebrated
mathematical theory which he contrived, and
which still bears his name.<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> In regard to electricity,
it is enough to notice, during the same period, the important
experiments of D'Alibard, followed by those
vast labours of Coulomb, which brought electrical
phenomena under the jurisdiction of the mathematics,
and thus completed what &#338;pinus had already prepared.<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a>
As to the laws of light, those ideas were now
accumulating which rendered possible the great steps
that, at the close of the century, were taken by Malus,
and still later by Fresnel.<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> Both of these eminent
Frenchmen not only made important additions to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
knowledge of double refraction, but Malus discovered
the polarization of light, undoubtedly the most splendid
contribution received by optical science since the
analysis of the solar rays.<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> It was also in consequence
of this, that Fresnel began those profound researches
which placed on a solid basis that great undulatory
theory of which Hooke, Huygens, and above all Young,
are to be deemed the founders, and by which the corpuscular
theory of Newton was finally overthrown.<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a></p>

<p>Thus much as to the progress of French knowledge
respecting those parts of nature which are in themselves
invisible, and of which we cannot tell whether they have
a material existence, or whether they are mere conditions
and properties of other bodies.<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> The immense
value of these discoveries, as increasing the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
known truths, is incontestable: but, at the same time,
another class of discoveries was made, which, dealing
more palpably with the visible world, and being also
more easily understood, produced more immediate results,
and, as I shall presently show, exercised a remarkable
influence in strengthening that democratic tendency
which accompanied the French Revolution. It is impossible,
within the limits I have assigned to myself, to
give anything like an adequate notion of the marvellous
activity with which the French now pushed their researches
into every department of the organic and inorganic
world; still it is, I think, practicable to compress
into a few pages such a summary of the more
salient points as will afford the reader some idea of what
was done by that generation of great thinkers which
flourished in France during the latter half of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>If we confine our view to the globe we inhabit, it
must be allowed that chemistry and geology are the two
sciences which not only offer the fairest promise, but
already contain the largest generalizations. The reason
of this will become clear, if we attend to the ideas on
which these two great subjects are based. The idea of
chemistry, is the study of composition;<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> the idea of
geology, is the study of position. The object of the first
is, to learn the laws which govern the properties of
matter; the object of the second is, to learn the laws
which govern its locality. In chemistry, we experiment;
in geology, we observe. In chemistry, we deal with
the molecular arrangement of the smallest atoms;<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a>
in geology, with the cosmological arrangement of the
largest masses. Hence it is that the chemist by his
minuteness, and the geologist by his grandeur, touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
the two extremes of the material universe; and,
starting from these opposite points, have, as I could
easily prove, a constantly increasing tendency to bring
under their own authority sciences which have at
present an independent existence, and which, for the
sake of a division of labour, it is still convenient to
study separately; though it must be the business of
philosophy, properly so called, to integrate them into a
complete and effective whole. Indeed it is obvious, that
if we knew all the laws of the composition of matter,
and likewise all the laws of its position, we should likewise
know all the changes of which matter is capable
spontaneously, that is, when uninterrupted by the mind
of man. Every phenomenon which any given substance
presents must be caused either by something taking
place in the substance, or else by something taking
place out of it, but acting upon it; while what occurs
within must be explicable by its own composition,
and what occurs without must be due to its position in
relation to the objects by which it is affected. This is
an exhaustive statement of every possible contingency,
and to one of these two classes of laws every thing must
be referrible; even those mysterious forces which, whether
they be emanations from matter, or whether they
be merely properties of matter, must in an ultimate
analysis depend either on the internal arrangement, or
else on the external locality of their physical antecedents.
However convenient, therefore, it may be, in
the present state of our knowledge, to speak of vital
principles, imponderable fluids, and elastic æthers, such
terms can only be provisional, and are to be considered
as mere names for that residue of unexplained facts,
which it will be the business of future ages to bring
under generalizations wide enough to cover and include
the whole.</p>

<p>These ideas of composition and of position being thus
the basis of all natural science, it is not surprising that
chemistry and geology, which are their best, but still
their insufficient representatives, should in modern times
have made more progress than any other of the great
branches of human knowledge. Although the chemists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
and geologists have not yet risen to the full height of
their respective subjects,<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> there are few things more
curious than to note the way in which, during the last
two generations, they have been rapidly expanding their
views&mdash;encroaching on topics with which, at first sight,
they appeared to have no concern&mdash;making other
branches of inquiry tributary to their own&mdash;and collecting
from every quarter that intellectual wealth which,
long hidden in obscure corners, had been wasted in the
cultivation of special and inferior pursuits. This, as
being one of the great intellectual characteristics of the
present age, I shall hereafter examine at considerable
length; but what I have now to show is, that in these
two vast sciences, which, though still very imperfect,
must eventually be superior to all others, the first important
steps were made by Frenchmen during the latter
half of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>That we owe to France the existence of chemistry as
a science, will be admitted by everyone who uses the
word science in the sense in which alone it ought to be
understood, namely, as a body of generalizations so
irrefragably true, that, though they may be subsequently
covered by higher generalizations, they cannot be overthrown
by them; in other words, generalizations which
may be absorbed, but not refuted. In this point of view,
there are in the history of chemistry only three great
stages. The first stage was the destruction of the
phlogistic theory, and the establishment, upon its ruins,
of the doctrines of oxidation, combustion, and respiration.
The second stage was the establishment of the
principle of definite proportions, and the application to
it of the atomic hypothesis. The third stage, above
which we have not yet risen, consists in the union of
chemical and electrical laws, and in the progress we are
making towards fusing into one generalization their
separate phenomena. Which of these three stages was
in its own age the most valuable, is not now the question;
but it is certain that the first of them was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
work of Lavoisier, by far the greatest of the French
chemists. Before him several important points had
been cleared up by the English chemists, whose experiments
ascertained the existence of bodies formerly unknown.
The links, however, to connect the facts, were
still wanting; and until Lavoisier entered the field,
there were no generalizations wide enough to entitle
chemistry to be called a science; or, to speak more properly,
the only large generalization commonly received
was that by Stahl, which the great Frenchman proved
to be not only imperfect, but altogether inaccurate. A
notice of the vast discoveries of Lavoisier will be found
in many well-known books:<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> it is enough to say, that
he not only worked out the laws of the oxidation of
bodies and of their combustion, but that he is the author
of the true theory of respiration, the purely chemical
character of which he first demonstrated; thus laying
the foundation of those views respecting the functions
of food, which the German chemists subsequently developed,
and which, as I have proved in the second
chapter of this Introduction, may be applied to solve
some great problems in the history of Man. The merit
of this was so obviously due to France, that though the
system now established was quickly adopted in other
countries,<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> it received the name of the French chemistry.<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a>
At the same time, the old nomenclature
being full of old errors, a new one was required, and
here again France took the initiative; since this great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
reformation was begun by four of her most eminent
chemists, who flourished only a few years before the
Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a></p>

<p>While one division of the French thinkers was reducing
to order the apparent irregularities of chemical
phenomena, another division of them was performing
precisely the same service for geology. The first step
towards popularizing this noble study was taken by
Buffon, who, in the middle of the eighteenth century,
broached a geological theory, which, though not quite
original, excited attention by its eloquence, and by the
lofty speculations with which he connected it.<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> This
was followed by the more special but still important
labours of Rouelle, Desmarest, Dolomieu, and Montlosier,
who, in less than forty years, effected a complete
revolution in the ideas of Frenchmen, by familiarizing
them with the strange conception, that the surface of
our planet, even where it appears perfectly stable, is
constantly undergoing most extensive changes. It began
to be understood, that this perpetual flux takes place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
not only in those parts of nature which are obviously
feeble and evanescent, but also in those which seem to
possess every element of strength and permanence, such
as the mountains of granite which wall the globe, and
are the shell and encasement in which it is held. As
soon as the mind became habituated to this notion of
universal change, the time was ripe for the appearance
of some great thinker, who should generalize the scattered
observations, and form them into a science, by
connecting them with some other department of knowledge,
of which the laws, or, at all events, the empirical
uniformities, had been already ascertained.</p>

<p>It was at this point, and while the inquiries of geologists,
notwithstanding their value, were still crude and
unsettled, that the subject was taken up by Cuvier, one
of the greatest naturalists Europe has ever produced. A
few others there are who have surpassed him in depth;
but in comprehensiveness it would be hard to find his
superior; and the immense range of his studies gave
him a peculiar advantage in surveying the operations
and dependencies of the external world.<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> This remarkable
man is unquestionably the founder of geology
as a science, since he is not only the first who saw the
necessity of bringing to bear upon it the generalizations
of comparative anatomy, but he is also the first who
actually, executing this great idea, succeeded in coördinating
the study of the strata of the earth with the
study of the fossil animals found in them.<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> Shortly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
before his researches were published, many valuable
facts had indeed been collected respecting the separate
strata; the primary formations being investigated by
the Germans, the secondary ones by the English.<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a>
But these observations, notwithstanding their merit,
were isolated; and they lacked that vast conception
which gave unity and grandeur to the whole, by connecting
inquiries concerning the inorganic changes of
the surface of the globe with other inquiries concerning
the organic changes of the animals the surface contained.</p>

<p>How completely this immense step is due to France,
is evident not only from the part played by Cuvier, but
also from the admitted fact, that to the French we owe
our knowledge respecting tertiary strata,<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> in which the
organic remains are most numerous, and the general
analogy to our present state is most intimate.<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> Another
circumstance may likewise be added, as pointing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
same conclusion. This is, that the first application of
the principles of comparative anatomy to the study of
fossil bones was also the work of a Frenchman, the
celebrated Daubenton. Hitherto these bones had been
the object of stupid wonder; some saying that they
were rained from heaven, others saying that they were
the gigantic limbs of the ancient patriarchs, men who
were believed to be tall because they were known to be
old.<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> Such idle conceits were for ever destroyed by
Daubenton, in a Memoir he published in 1762;<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> with
which, however, we are not now concerned, except that
it is evidence of the state of the French mind, and is
worth noting as a precursor of the discoveries of Cuvier.</p>

<p>By this union of geology and anatomy, there was first
introduced into the study of nature a clear conception
of the magnificent doctrine of universal change; while
at the same time there grew up by its side a conception
equally steady of the regularity with which the changes
are accomplished, and of the undeviating laws by
which they are governed. Similar ideas had no doubt
been occasionally held in preceding ages; but the great
Frenchmen of the eighteenth century were the first who
applied them to the entire structure of the globe, and
who thus prepared the way for that still higher view
for which their minds were not yet ripe,<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> but to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
in our own time the most advanced thinkers are rapidly
rising. For it is now beginning to be understood, that
since every addition to knowledge affords fresh proof
of the regularity with which all the changes of nature
are conducted, we are bound to believe that the same
regularity existed long before our little planet assumed
its present form, and long before man trod the surface
of the earth. We have the most abundant evidence
that the movements incessantly occurring in the material
world have a character of uniformity; and this
uniformity is so clearly marked, that in astronomy, the
most perfect of all the sciences, we are able to predict
events many years before they actually happen; nor
can any one doubt, that if on other subjects our science
were equally advanced, our predictions would be equally
accurate. It is, therefore, clear, that the burden of proof
lies not on those who assert the eternal regularity
of nature, but rather on those who deny it; and who set
up an imaginary period, to which they assign an imaginary
catastrophe, during which they say new laws
were introduced and a new order established. Such
gratuitous assumptions, even if they eventually turn out
to be true, are in the present state of knowledge unwarrantable,
and ought to be rejected, as the last remains
of those theological prejudices by which the
march of every science has in its turn been hindered.
These and all analagous notions work a double mischief.
They are mischievous, because they cripple the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
mind by imposing limits to its inquiries; and above all
they are mischievous, because they weaken that vast
conception of continuous and uninterrupted law, which
few indeed are able firmly to seize, but on which the
highest generalizations of future science must ultimately
depend.</p>

<p>It is this deep conviction, that changing phenomena
have unchanging laws, and that there are principles of
order to which all apparent disorder may be referred,&mdash;it
is this, which, in the seventeenth century, guided in
a limited field Bacon, Descartes, and Newton; which in
the eighteenth century was applied to every part of the
material universe; and which it is the business of the
nineteenth century to extend to the history of the
human intellect. This last department of inquiry we
owe chiefly to Germany; for, with the single exception
of Vico, no one even suspected the possibility of arriving
at complete generalizations respecting the progress
of man, until shortly before the French Revolution,
when the great German thinkers began to cultivate
this, the highest and most difficult of all studies. But
the French themselves were too much occupied with
physical science to pay attention to such matters;<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
and speaking generally, we may say that, in the eighteenth
century, each of the three leading nations of
Europe had a separate part to play. England diffused
a love of freedom; France, a knowledge of physical
science; while Germany, aided in some degree by Scotland,
revived the study of metaphysics, and created the
study of philosophic history. To this classification
some exceptions may of course be made; but that these
were the marked characteristics of the three countries,
is certain. After the death of Locke in 1704, and that
of Newton in 1727, there was in England a singular
dearth of great speculative thinkers; and this not
because the ability was wanting, but because it was
turned partly into practical pursuits, partly into political
contests. I shall hereafter examine the causes of this
peculiarity, and endeavour to ascertain the extent to
which it has influenced the fortunes of the country.
That the results were, on the whole, beneficial, I entertain
no doubt; but they were unquestionably injurious
to the progress of science, because they tended to divert
it from all new truths, except those likely to produce
obvious and practical benefit. The consequence was,
that though the English made several great discoveries,
they did not possess, during seventy years, a single man
who took a really comprehensive view of the phenomena
of nature; not one who could be compared with
those illustrious thinkers who in France reformed every
branch of physical knowledge. Nor was it until more
than two generations after the death of Newton, that
the first symptoms appeared of a remarkable reaction,
which quickly displayed itself in nearly every department
of the national intellect. In physics, it is enough
to mention Dalton, Davy, and Young, each of whom
was in his own field the founder of a new epoch; while
on other subjects I can only just refer, first, to the influence
of the Scotch school; and, secondly, to that
sudden and well-deserved admiration for the German
literature of which Coleridge was the principal exponent,
and which infused into the English mind a taste
for generalizations higher and more fearless than any
hitherto known. The history of this vast movement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
which began early in the nineteenth century, will be
traced in the future volumes of this work: at present
I merely notice it, as illustrating the fact, that until
the movement began, the English, though superior to
the French in several matters of extreme importance,
were for many years inferior to them in those large and
philosophic views, without which not only is the most
patient industry of no avail, but even real discoveries
lose their proper value, for want of such habits of generalization
as would trace their connexion with each
other, and consolidate their severed fragments into one
vast system of complete and harmonious truth.</p>

<p>The interest attached to these inquiries has induced
me to treat them at greater length than I had intended;
perhaps at greater length than is suitable to the suggestive
and preparatory character of this Introduction.
But the extraordinary success with which the French
now cultivated physical knowledge is so curious, on account
of its connexion with the Revolution, that I must
mention a few more of its most prominent instances:
though, for the sake of brevity, I will confine myself
to those three great divisions which, when put together,
form what is called Natural History, and in all of which
we shall see that the most important steps were taken in
France during the latter half of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In the first of these divisions, namely, the department
of zoology, we owe to the Frenchmen of the eighteenth
century those generalizations which are still the
highest this branch of knowledge has reached. Taking
zoology in the proper sense of the term, it consists only
of two parts, the anatomical part, which is its statics,
and the physiological part, which is its dynamics: the
first referring to the structure of animals; the other,
to their functions.<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> Both of these were worked out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
nearly at the same time, by Cuvier and Bichat; and
the leading conclusions at which they arrived, remain,
after the lapse of sixty years, undisturbed in their
essential points. In 1795, Cuvier laid down the great
principle, that the study and classification of animals
was to be, not as heretofore, with a view to external
peculiarities, but with a view to internal organization;
and that, therefore, no real advance could be made in
our knowledge except by extending the boundaries of
comparative anatomy.<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> This step, simple as it now
appears, was of immense importance, since by it zoology
was at once rescued from the hands of the observer,
and thrown into those of the experimenter: the consequence
of which has been the attainment of that precision
and accuracy of detail, which experiment alone can
give, and which is every way superior to such popular
facts as observation supplies. By thus indicating to
naturalists the true path of inquiry, by accustoming
them to a close and severe method, and by teaching
them to despise those vague descriptions in which they
had formerly delighted, Cuvier laid the foundation of
a progress which, during the last sixty years, has surpassed
the most sanguine expectations. This, then, is
the real service rendered by Cuvier, that he overthrew
the artificial system which the genius of Linnæus had
raised up,<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> and substituted in its place that far superior
scheme which gave the freest scope to future inquiry;
since, according to it, all systems are to be deemed imperfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
and provisional so long as any thing remains to
be learned respecting the comparative anatomy of the
animal kingdom. The influence exercised by this great
view was increased by the extraordinary skill and industry
with which its proposer followed it out, and
proved the practicability of his own precepts. His
additions to our knowledge of comparative anatomy are
probably more numerous than those made by any other
man; but what has gained him most celebrity is, the
comprehensive spirit with which he used what he acquired.
Independently of other generalizations, he is
the author of that vast classification of the whole animal
kingdom into vertebrata, mollusca, articulata, and radiata;<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a>
a classification which keeps its ground, and is
one of the most remarkable instances of that large and
philosophic spirit which France brought to bear upon
the phenomena of the material world.<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a></p>

<p>Great, however, as is the name of Cuvier, a greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
still remains behind. I allude, of course, to Bichat,
whose reputation is steadily increasing as our knowledge
advances, and who, if we compare the shortness
of his life with the reach and depth of his views, must
be pronounced the most profound thinker and the most
consummate observer by whom the organization of the
animal frame has yet been studied.<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> He wanted, indeed,
that comprehensive knowledge for which Cuvier
was remarkable; but though, on this account, his generalizations
were drawn from a smaller surface, they were,
on the other hand, less provisional: they were, I think,
more complete, and certainly they dealt with more momentous
topics. For the attention of Bichat was preëminently
directed to the human frame<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> in the largest
sense of the word; his object being so to investigate
the organization of man, as to rise, if possible, to some
knowledge concerning the causes and nature of life.
In this magnificent enterprise, considered as a whole,
he failed; but what he effected in certain parts of it is
so extraordinary, and has given such an impetus to
some of the highest branches of inquiry, that I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
briefly indicate his method, in order to compare it with
that other method which, at the same moment, Cuvier
adopted with immense success.</p>

<p>The important step taken by Cuvier was, that he
insisted on the necessity of a comprehensive study of the
organs of animals, instead of following the old plan of
merely describing their habits and external peculiarities.
This was a vast improvement, since, in the place
of loose and popular observations, he substituted direct
experiment, and hence introduced into zoology a precision
formerly unknown.<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> But Bichat, with a still
keener insight, saw that even this was not enough. He
saw that, each organ being composed of different tissues,
it was requisite to study the tissues themselves, before
we could learn the way in which, by their combinations,
the organs are produced. This, like all really great
ideas, was not entirely struck out by a single man; for
the physiological value of the tissues had been recognized
by three or four of the immediate predecessors of
Bichat, such as Carmichael, Smyth, Bonn, Bordeu, and
Fallopius. These inquirers, however, notwithstanding
their industry, had effected nothing of much moment,
since, though they collected several special facts, there
was in their observations that want of harmony and
that general incompleteness always characteristic of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
labours of men who do not rise to a commanding view
of the subject with which they deal.<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a></p>

<p>It was under these circumstances that Bichat began
those researches, which, looking at their actual and still
more at their prospective results, are probably the most
valuable contribution ever made to physiology by a
single mind. In 1801, only a year before his death,<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a>
he published his great work on anatomy, in which the
study of the organs is made altogether subservient to
the study of the tissues composing them. He lays it
down, that the body of man consists of twenty-one distinct
tissues, all of which, though essentially different,
have in common the two great properties of extensibility
and contractility.<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> These tissues he, with indefatigable
industry,<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> subjected to every sort of examination;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
he examined them in different ages and diseases,
with a view to ascertain the laws of their normal and
pathological development.<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> He studied the way each
tissue is affected by moisture, air, and temperature;
also the way in which their properties are altered by
various chemical substances,<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> and even their effect
on the taste.<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a> By these means, and by many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
experiments tending in the same direction, he took so
great and sudden a step, that he is to be regarded not
merely as an innovator on an old science, but rather as
the creator of a new one.<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> And although subsequent
observers have corrected some of his conclusions, this
has only been done by following his method; the value
of which is now so generally recognized, that it is
adopted by nearly all the best anatomists, who, differing
in other points, are agreed as to the necessity of basing
the future progress of anatomy on a knowledge of the
tissues, the supreme importance of which Bichat was
the first to perceive.<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a></p>

<p>The methods of Bichat and of Cuvier, when put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
together, exhaust the actual resources of zoological
science; so that all subsequent naturalists have been
compelled to follow one of these two schemes; that is,
either to follow Cuvier in comparing the organs of
animals, or else to follow Bichat in comparing the tissues
which compose the organs.<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> And inasmuch as one
comparison is chiefly suggestive of function, and the
other comparison of structure, it is evident, that to
raise the study of the animal world to the highest point
of which it is capable, both these great plans are
necessary; but if we ask which of the two plans, unaided
by the other, is more likely to produce important
results, the palm must, I think, be yielded to that proposed
by Bichat. Certainly, if we look at the question
as one to be decided by authority, a majority of the most
eminent anatomists and physiologists now incline to the
side of Bichat, rather than to that of Cuvier; while, as
a matter of history, it may be proved that the reputation
of Bichat has, with the advance of knowledge,
increased more rapidly than that of his great rival.
What, however, appears to me still more decisive, is,
that the two most important discoveries made in our
time respecting the classification of animals, are entirely
the result of the method which Bichat suggested. The
first discovery is that made by Agassiz, who, in the
course of his ichthyological researches, was led to
perceive that the arrangement by Cuvier according
to organs, did not fulfil its purpose in regard to fossil
fishes, because in the lapse of ages the characteristics
of their structure were destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> He, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
adopted the only other remaining plan, and studied the
tissues, which, being less complex than the organs, are
oftener found intact. The result was the very remarkable
discovery, that the tegumentary membrane of fishes is
so intimately connected with their organization, that if
the whole of a fish has perished except this membrane,
it is practicable, by noting its characteristics, to reconstruct
the animal in its most essential parts. Of the
value of this principle of harmony, some idea may be
formed from the circumstance, that on it Agassiz has
based the whole of that celebrated classification, of
which he is the sole author, and by which fossil ichthyology
has for the first time assumed a precise and
definite shape.<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a></p>

<p>The other discovery, of which the application is much
more extensive, was made in exactly the same way. It
consists of the striking fact, that the teeth of each
animal have a necessary connexion with the entire
organization of its frame; so that, within certain
limits, we can predict the organization by examining
the tooth. This beautiful instance of the regularity of
the operations of nature was not known until more than
thirty years after the death of Bichat, and it is evidently
due to the prosecution of that method which he sedulously
inculcated. For the teeth never having been
properly examined in regard to their separate tissues,
it was believed that they were essentially devoid of
structure, or, as some thought, were simply a fibrous
texture.<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> But by minute microscopic investigations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
it has been recently ascertained that the tissues of the
teeth are strictly analogous to those of other parts of
the body;<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> and that the ivory, or dentine, as it is now
called,<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> is highly organized; that it, as well as the
enamel, is cellular, and is, in fact, a development of
the living pulp. This discovery, which, to the philosophic
anatomist, is pregnant with meaning, was made
about 1838; and though the preliminary steps were
taken by Purkinjé, Retzius, and Schwann, the principal
merit is due to Nasmyth and Owen,<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a> between whom
it is disputed, but whose rival claims we are not here
called upon to adjust.<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> What I wish to observe is,
that the discovery is similar to that which we owe to
Agassiz; similar in the method by which it was worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
out, and also in the results which have followed from it.
Both are due to a recognition of the fundamental
maxim of Bichat, that the study of organs must be
subordinate to the study of tissues, and both have
supplied the most valuable aid to zoological classification.
On this point, the service rendered by Owen is
incontestable, whatever may be thought of his original
claims. This eminent naturalist has, with immense
industry, applied the discovery to all vertebrate animals;
and in an elaborate work, specially devoted to the
subject, he has placed beyond dispute the astonishing
fact, that the structure of a single tooth is a criterion
of the nature and organization of the species to which
it belongs.<a name="FNanchor_1108_1108" id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a></p>

<p>Whoever has reflected much on the different stages
through which our knowledge has successively passed,
must, I think, be led to the conclusion, that while fully
recognizing the great merit of these investigators of the
animal frame, our highest admiration ought to be
reserved not for those who make the discoveries, but
rather for those who point out how the discoveries are
to be made.<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> When the true path of inquiry has once
been indicated, the rest is comparatively easy. The
beaten highway is always open; and the difficulty is,
not to find those who will travel the old road, but those
who will make a fresh one. Every age produces in
abundance men of sagacity and of considerable industry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
who, while perfectly competent to increase the details
of a science, are unable to extend its distant boundaries.
This is because such extension must be accompanied by
a new method,<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a> which, to be valuable as well as new,
supposes on the part of its suggester, not only a complete
mastery over the resources of his subject, but also
the possession of originality and comprehensiveness,&mdash;the
two rarest forms of human genius. In this consists
the real difficulty of every great pursuit. As soon as
any department of knowledge has been generalized into
laws, it contains, either in itself or in its applications,
three distinct branches; namely, inventions, discoveries,
and method. Of these, the first corresponds to art; the
second to science; and the third to philosophy. In this
scale, inventions have by far the lowest place, and minds
of the highest order are rarely occupied by them. Next
in the series come discoveries; and here the province
of intellect really begins, since here the first attempt
is made to search after truth on its own account, and to
discard those practical considerations to which inventions
are of necessity referred. This is science properly
so called; and how difficult it is to reach this stage, is
evident from the fact, that all half-civilized nations have
made many great inventions, but no great discoveries.
The highest, however, of all the three stages, is the
philosophy of method, which bears the same relation
to science that science bears to art. Of its immense,
and indeed supreme importance, the annals of knowledge
supply abundant evidence; and for want of it, some
very great men have effected absolutely nothing, consuming
their lives in fruitless industry, not because their
labour was slack, but because their method was sterile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
The progress of every science is affected more by the
scheme according to which it is cultivated, than by the
actual ability of the cultivators themselves. If they who
travel in an unknown country, spend their force in running
on the wrong road, they will miss the point at
which they aim, and perchance may faint and fall by
the way. In that long and difficult journey after truth,
which the human mind has yet to perform, and of which
we in our generation can only see the distant prospect,
it is certain that success will depend not on the speed
with which men hasten in the path of inquiry, but
rather on the skill with which that path is selected for
them by those great and comprehensive thinkers, who
are as the lawgivers and founders of knowledge; because
they supply its deficiencies, not by investigating particular
difficulties, but by establishing some large and
sweeping innovation, which opens up a new vein of
thought, and creates fresh resources, which it is left for
their posterity to work out and apply.</p>

<p>It is from this point of view that we are to rate the
value of Bichat, whose works, like those of all men of
the highest eminence,&mdash;like those of Aristotle, Bacon,
and Descartes,&mdash;mark an epoch in the history of the
human mind; and as such, can only be fairly estimated
by connecting them with the social and intellectual
condition of the age in which they appeared. This
gives an importance and a meaning to the writings of
Bichat, of which few indeed are fully aware. The two
greatest recent discoveries respecting the classification
of animals are, as we have just seen, the result of his
teaching; but his influence has produced other effects
still more momentous. He, aided by Cabanis, rendered
to physiology the incalculable service, of preventing
it from participating in that melancholy reaction
to which France was exposed early in the nineteenth
century. This is too large a subject to discuss
at present; but I may mention, that when Napoleon,
not from feelings of conviction, but for selfish purposes
of his own, attempted to restore the power of ecclesiastical
principles, the men of letters, with disgraceful
subserviency, fell into his view; and there began a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
marked decline in that independent and innovating
spirit, with which during fifty years the French had
cultivated the highest departments of knowledge.
Hence that metaphysical school arose, which, though
professing to hold aloof from theology, was intimately
allied with it; and whose showy conceits form, in their
ephemeral splendour, a striking contrast to the severer
methods followed in the preceding generation.<a name="FNanchor_1111_1111" id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a>
Against this movement, the French physiologists have,
as a body, always protested; and it may be clearly
proved that their opposition, which even the great
abilities of Cuvier were unable to win over, is partly
due to the impetus given by Bichat, in enforcing in his
own pursuit the necessity of rejecting those assumptions
by which metaphysicians and theologians seek to control
every science. As an illustration of this I may
mention two facts worthy of note. The first is, that in
England, where during a considerable period the influence
of Bichat was scarcely felt, many, even of our
eminent physiologists, have shown a marked disposition
to ally themselves with the reactionary party; and have
not only opposed such novelties as they could not
immediately explain, but have degraded their own
noble science by making it a handmaid to serve the
purposes of natural theology. The other fact is, that
in France the disciples of Bichat have, with scarcely an
exception, rejected the study of final causes, to which
the school of Cuvier still adheres: while as a natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
consequence, the followers of Bichat are associated in
geology with the doctrine of uniformity; in zoology,
with that of the transmutation of species; and in astronomy,
with the nebular hypothesis: vast and magnificent
schemes, under whose shelter the human mind
seeks an escape from that dogma of interference, which
the march of knowledge every where reduces, and the
existence of which is incompatible with those conceptions
of eternal order, towards which, during the last
two centuries, we have been constantly tending.</p>

<p>These great phenomena, which the French intellect
presents, and of which I have only sketched a rapid
outline, will be related with suitable detail in the latter
part of this work, when I shall examine the present
condition of the European mind, and endeavour to estimate
its future prospects. To complete, however, our
appreciation of Bichat, it will be necessary to take
notice of what some consider the most valuable of all
his productions, in which he aimed at nothing less than
an exhaustive generalization of the functions of life.
It appears, indeed, to me, that in many important
points Bichat here fell short; but the work itself still
stands alone, and is so striking an instance of the genius
of the author, that I will give a short account of its
fundamental views.</p>

<p>Life considered as a whole has two distinct branches;<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a>
one branch being characteristic of animals, the other of
vegetables. That which is confined to animals is called
animal life; that which is common both to animals and
vegetables is called organic life. While, therefore,
plants have only one life, man has two distinct lives,
which are governed by entirely different laws, and
which, though intimately connected, constantly oppose
each other. In the organic life, man exists solely for
himself; in the animal life he comes in contact with
others. The functions of the first are purely internal,
those of the second are external. His organic life is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
limited to the double process of creation and destruction:
the creative process being that of assimilation, as
digestion, circulation, and nutrition; the destructive
process being that of excretion, such as exhalation and
the like. This is what man has in common with
plants; and of this life he, when in a natural state, is
unconscious. But the characteristic of his animal life
is consciousness, since by it he is made capable of
moving, of feeling, of judging. By virtue of the first
life he is merely a vegetable; by the addition of the
second he becomes an animal.</p>

<p>If now we look at the organs by which in man the
functions of these two lives are carried on, we shall be
struck by the remarkable fact, that the organs of his
vegetable life are very irregular, those of his animal
life very symmetrical. His vegetative, or organic, life
is conducted by the stomach, the intestines, and the
glandular system in general, such as the liver and the
pancreas; all of which are irregular, and admit of the
greatest variety of form and development, without their
functions being seriously disturbed. But in his animal
life the organs are so essentially symmetrical, that a
very slight departure from the ordinary type impairs
their action.<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> Not only the brain, but also the organs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
of sense, as the eyes, the nose, the ears, are perfectly
symmetrical; and they as well as the other organs of
animal life, as the feet and hands, are double, presenting
on each side of the body two separate parts which
correspond with each other, and produce a symmetry
unknown to our vegetative life, the organs of which are,
for the most part, merely single, as in the stomach,
liver, pancreas, and spleen.<a name="FNanchor_1114_1114" id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a></p>

<p>From this fundamental difference between the organs
of the two lives, there have arisen several other differences
of great interest. Our animal life being double,
while our organic life is single, it becomes possible for
the former life to take rest, that is, stop part of its
functions for a time, and afterwards renew them. But
in organic life, to stop is to die. The life, which we
have in common with vegetables, never sleeps; and if
its movements entirely cease only for a single instant,
they cease for ever. That process by which our bodies
receive some substances and give out others, admits of
no interruption; it is, by its nature, incessant, because,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
being single, it can never receive supplementary aid.
The other life we may refresh, not only in sleep, but
even when we are awake. Thus we can exercise the
organs of movement while we rest the organs of
thought; and it is even possible to relieve a function
while we continue to employ it, because, our animal life
being double, we are able for a short time, in case of
one of its parts being fatigued, to avail ourselves of the
corresponding part; using, for instance, a single eye or
a single arm, in order to rest the one which circumstances
may have exhausted; an expedient which the
single nature of organic life entirely prevents.<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a></p>

<p>Our animal life being thus essentially intermittent,
and our organic life being essentially continuous,<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> it
has necessarily followed that the first is capable of an
improvement of which the second is incapable. There
can be no improvement without comparison, since it is
only by comparing one state with another that we can
rectify previous errors, and avoid future ones. Now,
our organic life does not admit of such comparison,
because, being uninterrupted, it is not broken into
stages, but when unchequered by disease, runs on in
dull monotony. On the other hand, the functions of
our animal life, such as thought, speech, sight, and
motion, cannot be long exercised without rest; and as
they are constantly suspended, it becomes practicable
to compare them, and, therefore, to improve them. It
is by possessing this resource that the first cry of the
infant gradually rises into the perfect speech of the
man, and the unformed habits of early thought are
ripened into that maturity which nothing can give but
a long series of successive efforts.<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> But our organic
life, which we have in common with vegetables, admits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
of no interruption, and consequently of no improvement.
It obeys its own laws; but it derives no benefit from
that repetition to which animal life is exclusively indebted.
Its functions, such as nutrition and the like,
exist in man several months before he is born, and
while, his animal life not having yet begun, the faculty
of comparison, which is the basis of improvement, is
impossible.<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> And although, as the human frame increases
in size, its vegetative organs become larger, it
cannot be supposed that their functions really improve,
since, in ordinary cases, their duties are performed as
regularly and as completely in childhood as in middle
age.<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a></p>

<p>Thus it is, that although other causes conspire, it
may be said that the progressiveness of animal life is
due to its intermittence; the unprogressiveness of organic
life to its continuity. It may, moreover, be said,
that the intermittence of the first life results from the
symmetry of its organs, while the continuity of the
second life results from their irregularity. To this wide
and striking generalization, many objections may be
made, some of them apparently insuperable; but that
it contains the germs of great truths I entertain little
doubt, and, at all events, it is certain that the method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
cannot be too highly praised, for it unites the study of
function and structure with that of embryology, of
vegetable physiology, of the theory of comparison, and
of the influence of habit; a vast and magnificent field,
which the genius of Bichat was able to cover, but of
which, since him, neither physiologists nor metaphysicians
have even attempted a general survey.</p>

<p>This stationary condition, during the present century,
of a subject of such intense interest, is a decisive proof
of the extraordinary genius of Bichat; since, notwithstanding
the additions made to physiology, and to every
branch of physics connected with it, nothing has been
done at all comparable to that theory of life which he,
with far inferior resources, was able to construct. This
stupendous work he left, indeed, very imperfect; but
even in its deficiencies we see the hand of the great
master, whom, on his own subject, no one has yet approached.
His essay on life may well be likened to
those broken fragments of ancient art, which, imperfect
as they are, still bear the impress of the inspiration
which gave them birth, and present in each separate
part that unity of conception which to us makes them
a complete and living whole.</p>

<p>From the preceding summary of the progress of physical
knowledge, the reader may form some idea of the
ability of those eminent men who arose in France
during the latter half of the eighteenth century. To
complete the picture, it is only necessary to examine
what was done in the two remaining branches of natural
history, namely, botany and mineralogy, in both of
which the first great steps towards raising each study
to a science were taken by Frenchmen a few years
before the Revolution.</p>

<p>In botany, although our knowledge of particular
facts has, during the last hundred years, rapidly increased,<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a>
we are only possessed of two generalizations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
wide enough to be called laws of nature. The first
generalization concerns the structure of plants; the
other concerns their physiology. That concerning their
physiology is the beautiful morphological law, according
to which the different appearance of the various
organs arises from arrested development: the stamens,
pistils, corolla, calyx, and bracts being simple modifications
or successive stages of the leaf. This is one of
many valuable discoveries we owe to Germany; it being
made by Göthe late in the eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> With
its importance every botanist is familiar; while to the
historian of the human mind it is peculiarly interesting,
as strengthening that great doctrine of development,
towards which the highest branches of knowledge are
now hastening, and which, in the present century, has
been also carried into one of the most difficult departments
of animal physiology.<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>But the most comprehensive truth with which we
are acquainted respecting plants, is that which includes
the whole of their general structure; and this we learnt
from those great Frenchmen who, in the latter half of
the eighteenth century, began to study the external
world. The first steps were taken directly after the
middle of the century, by Adanson, Duhamel de Monceau,
and, above all, Desfontaines; three eminent thinkers,
who proved the practicability of a natural method hitherto
unknown, and of which even Ray himself had only a
faint perception.<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a> This, by weakening the influence
of the artificial system of Linnæus,<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> prepared the way
for an innovation more complete than has been effected
in any other branch of knowledge. In the very year in
which the Revolution occurred, Jussieu put forward a
series of botanical generalizations, of which the most
important are all intimately connected, and still remain
the highest this department of inquiry has reached.<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
Among these, I need only mention the three vast propositions
which are now admitted to form the basis of
vegetable anatomy. The first is, that the vegetable
kingdom, in its whole extent, is composed of plants
either with one cotyledon, or with two cotyledons, or
else with no cotyledon at all. The second proposition
is, that this classification, so far from being artificial, is
strictly natural; since it is a law of nature, that plants
having one cotyledon are endogenous, and grow by
additions made to the centre of their stems, while, on
the other hand, plants having two cotyledons are exogenous,
and are compelled to grow by additions made,
not to the centre of their stems, but to the circumference.<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a>
The third proposition is, that when plants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
grow at their centre, the arrangement of the fruit and
leaves is threefold; when, however, they grow at the
circumference, it is nearly always fivefold.<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a></p>

<p>This is what was effected by the Frenchmen of the
eighteenth century for the vegetable kingdom:<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a> and
if we now turn to the mineral kingdom, we shall find
that our obligations to them are equally great. The
study of minerals is the most imperfect of the three
branches of natural history, because, notwithstanding
its apparent simplicity, and the immense number of experiments
which have been made, the true method of
investigation has not yet been ascertained; it being
doubtful whether mineralogy ought to be subordinated
to the laws of chemistry, or to those of crystallography,
or whether both sets of laws will have to be considered.<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a>
At all events it is certain that, down to
the present time, chemistry has shown itself unable to
reduce mineralogical phenomena; nor has any chemist,
possessing sufficient powers of generalization, attempted
the task except Berzelius; and most of his conclusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
were overthrown by the splendid discovery of isomorphism,
for which, as is well known, we are indebted to
Mitscherlich, one of the many great thinkers Germany
has produced.<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a></p>

<p>Although the chemical department of mineralogy is
in an unformed and indeed anarchical condition, its
other department, namely, crystallography, has made
great progress; and here again the earliest steps were
taken by two Frenchmen, who lived in the latter half
of the eighteenth century. About 1760, Romé De
Lisle<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> set the first example of studying crystals, according
to a scheme so large as to include all the varieties
of their primary forms, and to account for their irregularities,
and the apparent caprice with which they were
arranged. In this investigation he was guided by the
fundamental assumption, that what is called an irregularity,
is in truth perfectly regular, and that the operations
of nature are invariable.<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> Scarcely had this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
great idea been applied to the almost innumerable forms
into which minerals crystallize, when it was followed
up with still larger resources by Haüy, another eminent
Frenchman.<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> This remarkable man achieved a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
complete union between mineralogy and geometry; and,
bringing the laws of space to bear on the molecular
arrangements of matter, he was able to penetrate into
the intimate structure of crystals.<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a> By this means, he
succeeded in proving that the secondary forms of all
crystals are derived from their primary forms by a
regular process of decrement;<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> and that, when a substance
is passing from a liquid to a solid state, its particles
are compelled to cohere, according to a scheme
which provides for every possible change, since it includes
even those subsequent layers which alter the
ordinary type of the crystal, by disturbing its natural
symmetry.<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> To ascertain that such violations of symmetry
are susceptible of mathematical calculation, was
to make a vast addition to our knowledge; but what
seems to me still more important is, that it indicates an
approach to the magnificent idea, that every thing which
occurs is regulated by law, and that confusion and disorder
are impossible.<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a> For, by proving that even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
most uncouth and singular forms of minerals are the
natural results of their antecedents, Haüy laid the
foundation of what may be called the pathology of the
inorganic world. However paradoxical such a notion
may seem, it is certain that symmetry is to crystals
what health is to animals; so that an irregularity of
shape in the first, corresponds with an appearance of
disease in the second.<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> When, therefore, the minds of
men became familiarized with the great truth, that in
the mineral kingdom there is, properly speaking, no
irregularity, it became more easy for them to grasp the
still higher truth, that the same principle holds good
of the animal kingdom, although, from the superior
complexity of the phenomena, it will be long before we
can arrive at an equal demonstration. But, that such a
demonstration is possible, is the principle upon which
the future progress of all organic, and indeed of all
mental science, depends. And it is very observable,
that the same generation which established the fact,
that the apparent aberrations presented by minerals are
strictly regular, also took the first steps towards establishing
the far higher fact, that the aberrations of the
human mind are governed by laws as unfailing as
those which determine the condition of inert matter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
The examination of this would lead to a digression
foreign to my present design; but I may mention that, at
the end of the century, there was written in France the
celebrated treatise on insanity, by Pinel; a work remarkable
in many respects, but chiefly in this, that in it
the old notions respecting the mysterious and inscrutable
character of mental disease are altogether discarded:<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a>
the disease itself is considered as a
phenomenon inevitably occurring under certain given
conditions, and the foundation laid for supplying another
link in that vast chain of evidence which connects
the material with the immaterial, and thus uniting
mind and matter into a single study, is now preparing
the way for some generalization, which, being common
to both, shall serve as a centre round which the
disjointed fragments of our knowledge may safely
rally.</p>

<p>These were the views which, during the latter half
of the eighteenth century, began to dawn upon French
thinkers. The extraordinary ability and success with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
which these eminent men cultivated their respective
sciences, I have traced at a length greater that I had
intended, but still very inadequate to the importance
of the subject. Enough, however, has been brought
forward, to convince the reader of the truth of the proposition
I wished to prove; namely, that the intellect
of France was, during the latter half of the eighteenth
century, concentrated upon the external world with unprecedented
zeal, and thus aided that vast movement,
of which the Revolution itself was merely a single consequence.
The intimate connexion between scientific
progress and social rebellion, is evident from the fact,
that both are suggested by the same yearning after improvement,
the same dissatisfaction with what has been
previously done, the same restless, prying, insubordinate,
and audacious spirit. But in France this general analogy
was strengthened by the curious circumstances I
have already noticed, by virtue of which, the activity of
the country was, during the first half of the century,
directed against the church rather than against the
state; so that in order to complete the antecedents of
the Revolution, it was necessary that, in the latter half
of the century, the ground of attack should be shifted.
This is precisely what was done by the wonderful impetus
given to every branch of natural science. For,
the attention of men being thus steadily fixed upon the
external world, the internal fell into neglect; while, as
the external corresponds to the state, and the internal
to the church, it was part of the same intellectual
development, that the assailers of the existing fabric
should turn against political abuses the energy which
the preceding generation had reserved for religious
ones.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the French Revolution, like every
great revolution the world has yet seen, was preceded
by a complete change in the habits and associations of
the national intellect. But besides this, there was also
taking place, precisely at the same time, a vast social
movement, which was intimately connected with the
intellectual movement, and indeed formed part of it, in
so far as it was followed by similar results and produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
by similar causes. The nature of this social revolution
I shall examine only very briefly, because in a future
volume it will be necessary to trace its history minutely,
in order to illustrate the slighter but still remarkable
changes which in the same period were going on in
English society.</p>

<p>In France, before the Revolution, the people, though
always very social, were also very exclusive. The
upper classes, protected by an imaginary superiority,
looked with scorn upon those whose birth or titles were
unequal to their own. The class immediately below
them copied and communicated their example, and
every order in society endeavoured to find some fanciful
distinction which should guard them from the contamination
of their inferiors. The only three real sources
of superiority,&mdash;the superiority of morals, of intellect,
and of knowledge,&mdash;were entirely overlooked in this
absurd scheme; and men became accustomed to pride
themselves not on any essential difference, but on those
inferior matters, which, with extremely few exceptions,
are the result of accident, and therefore no test of
merit.<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a></p>

<p>The first great blow to this state of things, was the
unprecedented impulse given to the cultivation of
physical science. Those vast discoveries which were
being made, not only stimulated the intellect of thinking
men, but even roused the curiosity of the more
thoughtless parts of society. The lectures of chemists,
of geologists, of mineralogists, and of physiologists,
were attended by those who came to wonder, as well as
by those who came to learn. In Paris, the scientific
assemblages were crowded to overflowing.<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a> The halls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
and amphitheatres in which the great truths of nature
were expounded, were no longer able to hold their
audience, and in several instances it was found necessary
to enlarge them.<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> The sittings of the Academy,
instead of being confined to a few solitary scholars,
were frequented by every one whose rank or influence
enabled them to secure a place.<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> Even women of
fashion, forgetting their usual frivolity, hastened to
hear discussions on the composition of a mineral, on
the discovery of a new salt, on the structure of plants,
on the organization of animals, on the properties of the
electric fluid.<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> A sudden craving after knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
seemed to have smitten every rank. The largest and
the most difficult inquiries found favour in the eyes of
those whose fathers had hardly heard the names of the
sciences to which they belonged. The brilliant imagination
of Buffon made geology suddenly popular; the
same thing was effected for chemistry by the eloquence
of Fourcroy, and for electricity by Nollet; while the
admirable expositions of Lalande caused astronomy itself
to be generally cultivated. In a word, it is enough
to say, that during the thirty years preceding the
Revolution, the spread of physical science was so rapid,
that in its favour the old classical studies were despised;<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a>
it was considered the essential basis of a good
education, and some slight acquaintance with it was
deemed necessary for every class, except those who
were obliged to support themselves by their daily
labour.<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>The results produced by this remarkable change are
very curious, and from their energy and rapidity were
very decisive. As long as the different classes confined
themselves to pursuits peculiar to their own sphere,
they were encouraged to preserve their separate habits;
and the subordination, or, as it were, the hierarchy, of
society was easily maintained. But when the members
of the various orders met in the same place with the
same object, they became knit together by a new sympathy.
The highest and most durable of all pleasures,
the pleasure caused by the perception of fresh truths,
was now a great link, which banded together those
social elements that were formerly wrapped up in the
pride of their own isolation. Besides this, there was
also given to them not only a new pursuit, but also a
new standard of merit. In the amphitheatre and the
lecture-room, the first object of attention is the professor
and the lecturer. The division is between those who
teach and those who learn. The subordination of ranks
makes way for the subordination of knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a> The
petty and conventional distinctions of fashionable life
are succeeded by those large and genuine distinctions,
by which alone man is really separated from man. The
progress of the intellect supplies a new object of veneration;
the old worship of rank is rudely disturbed,
and its superstitious devotees are taught to bow the
knee before what to them is the shrine of a strange god.
The hall of science is the temple of democracy. Those
who come to learn, confess their own ignorance, abrogate
in some degree their own superiority, and begin to
perceive that the greatness of men has no connexion
with the splendour of their titles, or the dignity
of their birth; that it is not concerned with their
quarterings, their escutcheons, their descents, their
dexter-chiefs, their sinister-chiefs, their chevrons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
their bends, their azures, their gules, and the other
trumperies of their heraldry; but that it depends upon
the largeness of their minds, the powers of their
intellect, and the fullness of their knowledge.</p>

<p>These were the views which, in the latter half of the
eighteenth century, began to influence those classes
which had long been the undisputed masters of
society.<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> And what shows the strength of this great
movement is, that it was accompanied by other social
changes, which, though in themselves apparently
trifling, become full of meaning when taken in connexion
with the general history of the time.</p>

<p>While the immense progress of physical knowledge
was revolutionizing society, by inspiring the different
classes with an object common to all, and thus raising
a new standard of merit, a more trivial, but equally
democratic tendency was observable even in the conventional
forms of social life. To describe the whole of
these changes would occupy a space disproportioned to
the other parts of this Introduction; but it is certain
that, until the changes have been carefully examined,
it will be impossible for any one to write a history of
the French Revolution. As a specimen of what I mean,
I will notice two of these innovations which are very
conspicuous, and are also interesting on account of
their analogy with what has happened in English
society.</p>

<p>The first of these changes was an alteration in dress,
and a marked contempt for those external appearances
hitherto valued as one of the most important of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
matters. During the reign of Louis XIV., and indeed
during the first half of the reign of Louis XV., not only
men of frivolous tastes, but even those distinguished for
their knowledge, displayed in their attire a dainty
precision, a nice and studied adjustment, a pomp of
gold, of silver, and of ruffles, such as in our days can
nowhere be seen, except in the courts of European
princes, where a certain barbarian splendour is still
retained. So far was this carried, that in the seventeenth
century the rank of a person might be immediately
known by his appearance; no one presuming
to usurp a garb worn by the class immediately above
his own.<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> But in that democratic movement which
preceded the French Revolution, the minds of men
became too earnest, too intent upon higher matters, to
busy themselves with those idle devices which engrossed
the attention of their fathers. A contemptuous disregard
of such distinctions became general. In Paris the
innovation was seen even in those gay assemblies,
where a certain amount of personal decoration is still
considered natural. At dinners, suppers, and balls, it
is noticed by contemporary observers, that the dress
usually worn was becoming so simple as to cause a
confusion of ranks, until at length every distinction was
abandoned by both sexes; the men, on such occasions,
coming in a common frock-coat, the women in their
ordinary morning gowns.<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> Nay, to such a pitch was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
this carried, that we are assured by the Prince de
Montbarey, who was in Paris at the time, that shortly
before the Revolution, even those who had stars and
orders were careful to hide them by buttoning their
coats, so that these marks of superiority might no longer
be seen.<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a></p>

<p>The other innovation to which I have referred is
equally interesting as characteristic of the spirit of the
time. This is, that the tendency to amalgamate the
different orders of society<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> was shown in the institution
of clubs; a remarkable contrivance, which to us
seems perfectly natural because we are accustomed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
it, but of which it may be truly said, that until the
eighteenth century its existence was impossible. Before
the eighteenth century, each class was so jealous of its
superiority over the one below it, that to meet together
on equal terms was impracticable; and although a
certain patronizing familiarity towards one's inferiors
might be safely indulged in, this only marked the
immense interval of separation, since the great man had
no fear of his condescension being abused. In those
good old times a proper respect was paid to rank and
birth; and he who could count his twenty ancestors
was venerated to an extent of which we, in these degenerate
days, can hardly form an idea. As to any thing
like social equality, that was a notion too preposterous
to be conceived; nor was it possible that any institution
should exist which placed mere ordinary men on a level
with those illustrious characters, whose veins were filled
with the purest blood, and the quarterings of whose
arms none could hope to rival.</p>

<p>But in the eighteenth century the progress of knowledge
became so remarkable, that the new principle of
intellectual superiority made rapid encroachments on
the old principle of aristocratic superiority. As soon
as these encroachments had reached a certain point,
they gave rise to an institution suited to them; and
thus it was that there were first established clubs, in
which all the educated classes could assemble, without
regard to those other differences which, in the preceding
period, kept them separate. The peculiarity of this
was, that, for mere purposes of social enjoyment, men
were brought into contact, who, according to the aristocratic
scheme, had nothing in common, but who were
now placed on the same footing in so far as they
belonged to the same establishment, conformed to the
same rules, and reaped the same advantages. It was,
however, expected that the members, though varying in
many other respects, were to be all, in some degree,
educated; and in this way society first distinctly recognized
a classification previously unknown; the division
between noble and ignoble being succeeded by another
division between educated and uneducated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>The rise and growth of clubs is, therefore, to the philosophic
observer, a question of immense importance;
and it is one which, as I shall hereafter prove, played a
great part in the history of England during the latter
half of the eighteenth century. In reference to our
present subject, it is interesting to observe, that the first
clubs, in the modern sense of the word, which ever
existed in Paris, were formed about 1782, only seven
years before the French Revolution. At the beginning
they were merely intended to be social assemblages;
but they quickly assumed a democratic character, conformable
to the spirit of the age. Their first result, as
was noticed by a keen observer of what was then passing,
was to make the manners of the upper classes more
simple than they had hitherto been, and to weaken that
love of form and ceremony suitable to their earlier habits.
These clubs likewise effected a remarkable separation
between the sexes; and it is recorded, that after their
establishment, women associated more with each other,
and were oftener seen in public unaccompanied by
men.<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> This had the effect of encouraging among men
a republican roughness, which the influence of the other
sex would have tended to keep down. All these things
effaced the old lines of demarcation between the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
ranks, and by merging the various classes into one,
made the force of their united opposition irresistible,
and speedily overthrew both the church and the state.
The exact period at which the clubs became political
cannot, of course, be ascertained, but the change seems
to have taken place about 1784.<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> From this moment
all was over; and although the government, in 1787,
issued orders to close the leading club, in which all
classes discussed political questions, it was found impossible
to stem the current. The order, therefore,
was rescinded; the club re-assembled, and no further
attempt was made to interrupt that course of affairs
which a long train of preceding events had rendered
inevitable.<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a></p>

<p>While all these things were conspiring to overthrow
the old institutions, an event suddenly occurred which
produced the most remarkable effects in France, and is
itself strikingly characteristic of the spirit of the eighteenth
century. On the other side of the Atlantic, a
great people, provoked by the intolerable injustice of
the English government, rose in arms, turned on their
oppressors, and, after a desperate struggle, gloriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
obtained their independence. In 1776, the Americans
laid before Europe that noble Declaration, which ought
to be hung up in the nursery of every king, and blazoned
on the porch of every royal palace. In words,
the memory of which can never die, they declared, that
the object of the institution of government is to secure
the rights of the people; that from the people alone it
derives its powers; and &lsquo;that whenever any form of
government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the
right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute
a new government, laying its foundations on such
principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as
to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and
happiness.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a></p>

<p>If this declaration had been made only one generation
earlier, the whole of France, with the exception of a few
advanced thinkers, would have rejected it with horror
and with scorn. Such, however, was now the temper
of the public mind, that the doctrines it contained were
not merely welcomed by a majority of the French
nation, but even the government itself was unable to
withstand the general feeling.<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> In 1776, Franklin
arrived in France, as envoy from the American people.
He met with the warmest reception from all classes,<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a>
and succeeded in inducing the government to sign a
treaty, engaging to defend the young republic in the
rights it had gloriously won.<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> In Paris, the enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
was irresistible.<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> From every quarter large bodies
of men came forward, volunteering to cross the Atlantic
and to fight for the liberties of America. The heroism
with which these auxiliaries aided the noble struggle,
forms a cheering passage in the history of that time;
but is foreign to my present purpose, which is merely
to notice its effect in hastening the approach of the
French Revolution. And this effect was indeed most
remarkable. Besides the indirect result produced by
the example of a successful rebellion, the French were
still further stimulated by actual contact with their new
allies. The French officers and soldiers who served in
America, introduced into their own country, on their
return, those democratic opinions which they had imbibed
in the infant republic.<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> By this means, fresh
strength was given to the revolutionary tendencies
already prevalent; and it is worthy of remark, that
Lafayette borrowed from the same source one of his
most celebrated acts. He drew his sword on behalf of
the Americans; and they, in their turn, communicated
to him that famous doctrine respecting the rights of
man, which, at his instigation, was formally adopted by
the National Assembly.<a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> Indeed, there is reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
believe, that the final blow the French government
received was actually dealt by the hand of an American;
for it is said that it was in consequence of the advice of
Jefferson, that the popular part of the legislative body
proclaimed itself the National Assembly, and thus set
the crown at open defiance.<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a></p>

<p>I have now brought to a close my examination of the
causes of the French Revolution; but before concluding
the present chapter, it appears to me that the variety of
topics which have been discussed, makes it advisable
that I should sum up their leading points; and should
state, as briefly as possible, the steps of that long and
complicated argument, by which I have attempted to
prove, that the Revolution was an event inevitably
arising out of preceding circumstances. Such a summary,
by recalling the entire subject before the reader,
will remedy any confusion which the fullness of detail
may have produced, and will simplify an investigation
which many will consider to have been needlessly
protracted; but which could not have been abridged
without weakening, in some essential part, the support
of those general principles that I seek to establish.</p>

<p>Looking at the state of France immediately after the
death of Louis XIV., we have seen that, his policy
having reduced the country to the brink of ruin, and
having destroyed every vestige of free inquiry, a reaction
became necessary; but that the materials for the
reaction could not be found among a nation, which for
fifty years had been exposed to so debilitating a system.
This deficiency at home, caused the most eminent
Frenchmen to turn their attention abroad, and gave rise
to a sudden admiration for the English literature, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
for those habits of thought which were then peculiar to
the English people. New life being thus breathed into
the wasted frame of French society, an eager and
inquisitive spirit was generated, such as had not been
seen since the time of Descartes. The upper classes,
taking offence at this unexpected movement, attempted
to stifle it, and made strenuous efforts to destroy that
love of inquiry which was daily gaining ground. To
effect their object, they persecuted literary men with
such bitterness, as to make it evident that the intellect
of France must either relapse into its former servility,
or else boldly assume the offensive. Happily for the
interests of civilization, the latter alternative was
adopted; and, in or about 1750, a deadly struggle
began, in which those principles of liberty which France
borrowed from England, and which had hitherto been
supposed only applicable to the church, were for the
first time applied to the state. Coinciding with this
movement, and indeed forming part of it, other circumstances
occurred of the same character. Now it was
that the political economists succeeded in proving that
the interference of the governing classes had inflicted
great mischief even upon the material interests of the
country; and had, by their protective measures, injured
what they were believed to have benefited. This
remarkable discovery in favour of general freedom, put
a fresh weapon into the hands of the democratic party;
whose strength was still further increased by the unrivalled
eloquence with which Rousseau assailed the
existing fabric. Precisely the same tendency was
exhibited in the extraordinary impulse given to every
branch of physical science, which familiarized men with
ideas of progress, and brought them into collision with
the stationary and conservative ideas natural to government.
The discoveries made respecting the external
world, encouraged a restlessness and excitement of
mind hostile to the spirit of routine, and therefore full
of danger for institutions only recommended by their
antiquity. This eagerness for physical knowledge also
effected a change in education; and the ancient languages
being neglected, another link was severed which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
connected the present with the past. The church, the
legitimate protector of old opinions, was unable to resist
the passion for novelty, because she was weakened by
treason in her own camp. For by this time, Calvinism
had spread so much among the French clergy, as to
break them into two hostile parties, and render it
impossible to rally them against their common foe.
The growth of this heresy was also important, because
Calvinism being essentially democratic, a revolutionary
spirit appeared even in the ecclesiastical profession, so
that the feud in the church was accompanied by another
feud between the government and the church. These
were the leading symptoms of that vast movement
which culminated in the French Revolution; and all of
them indicated a state of society so anarchical and so
thoroughly disorganized, as to make it certain that
some great catastrophe was impending. At length,
and when everything was ready for explosion, the news
of the American Rebellion fell like a spark on the
inflammatory mass, and ignited a flame which never
ceased its ravages until it had destroyed all that
Frenchmen once held dear, and had left for the
instruction of mankind an awful lesson of the crimes
into which continued oppression may hurry a generous
and long-suffering people.</p>

<p>Such is a rapid outline of the view which my studies
have led me to take of the causes of the French Revolution.
That I have ascertained all the causes, I do not
for a moment suppose; but it will, I believe, be found
that none of importance have been omitted. It is,
indeed, true, that among the materials of which the
evidence consists, many deficiencies will be seen; and a
more protracted labour would have been rewarded by a
greater success. Of these shortcomings I am deeply
sensible; and I can only regret that the necessity of
passing on to a still larger field has compelled me to
leave so much for future inquirers to gather in. At the
same time, it ought to be remembered, that this is the
first attempt which has ever been made to study the
antecedents of the French Revolution according to a
scheme wide enough to include the whole of their intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
bearings. In defiance of sound philosophy, and,
I may say, in defiance of common understanding, historians
obstinately persist in neglecting those great
branches of physical knowledge, in which in every
civilized country the operations of the human mind
may be most clearly seen, and therefore the mental
habits most easily ascertained. The result is, that the
French Revolution, unquestionably the most important,
the most complicated, and the most glorious event in
history, has been given over to authors, many of whom
have displayed considerable ability, but all of whom
have shown themselves destitute of that preliminary
scientific education, in the absence of which it is impossible
to seize the spirit of any period, or to take a
comprehensive survey of its various parts. Thus, to
mention only a single instance: we have seen that the
extraordinary impulse given to the study of the external
world was intimately connected with that democratic
movement which overthrew the institutions of France.
But this connexion historians have been unable to
trace; because they were unacquainted with the progress
of the various branches of natural philosophy and
of natural history. Hence it is that they have exhibited
their great subject maimed and mutilated, shorn of
those fair proportions which it ought to possess. According
to this scheme, the historian sinks into the
annalist; so that, instead of solving a problem, he
merely paints a picture. Without, therefore, disparaging
the labours of those industrious men who have
collected materials for a history of the French Revolution,
we may assuredly say, that the history itself has
never been written; since they who have attempted the
task have not possessed such resources as would
enable them to consider it as merely a single part of
that far larger movement which was seen in every
department of science, of philosophy, of religion, and of
politics.</p>

<p>Whether or not I have effected anything of real
value towards remedying this deficiency, is a question
for competent judges to decide. Of this, at least, I feel
certain, that whatever imperfections may be observed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
the fault consists, not in the method proposed, but in
the extreme difficulty of any single man putting into
full operation all the parts of so vast a scheme. It is
on this point, and on this alone, that I feel the need of
great indulgence. But, as to the plan itself, I have no
misgivings; because I am deeply convinced that the
time is fast approaching when the history of Man will
be placed on its proper footing; when its study will be
recognized as the noblest and most arduous of all pursuits;
and when it will be clearly seen, that, to cultivate
it with success, there is wanted a wide and comprehensive
mind, richly furnished with the highest branches
of human knowledge. When this is fully admitted,
history will be written only by those whose habits fit
them for the task; and it will be rescued from the
hands of biographers, genealogists, collectors of anecdotes,
chroniclers of courts, of princes, and of nobles,&mdash;those
babblers of vain things, who lie in wait at every
corner, and infest this the public highway of our
national literature. That such compilers should trespass
on a province so far above their own, and should think
that by these means they can throw light on the affairs
of men, is one of many proofs of the still backward
condition of our knowledge, and of the indistinctness
with which its boundaries have been mapped out. If I
have done anything towards bringing these intrusions
into discredit, and inspiring historians themselves with
a sense of the dignity of their own calling, I shall have
rendered in my time some little service, and I shall be
well content to have it said, that in many cases I have
failed in executing what I originally proposed. Indeed,
that there are in this volume several instances of such
failure, I willingly allow; and I can only plead the
immensity of the subject, the shortness of a single life,
and the imperfection of every single enterprise. I,
therefore, wish this work to be estimated, not according
to the finish of its separate parts, but according to the
way in which those parts have been fused into a complete
and symmetrical whole. This, in an undertaking
of such novelty and magnitude, I have a right to expect.
And I would, moreover, add, that if the reader has met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
with opinions adverse to his own, he should remember
that his views are, perchance, the same as those which
I too once held, and which I have abandoned, because,
after a wider range of study, I found them unsupported
by solid proof, subversive of the interests of Man, and
fatal to the progress of his knowledge. To examine
the notions in which we have been educated, and to
turn aside from those which will not bear the test, is a
task so painful, that they who shrink from the suffering
should pause before they reproach those by whom the
suffering is undergone. What I have put forward may,
no doubt, be erroneous; but it is, at all events, the
result of an honest searching after truth, of unsparing
labour, of patient and anxious reflection. Conclusions
arrived at in this way, are not to be overturned by
stating that they endanger some other conclusions; nor
can they be even affected by allegations against their
supposed tendency. The principles which I advocate,
are based upon distinct arguments, supported by well-ascertained
facts. The only points, therefore, to be
ascertained, are, whether the arguments are fair, and
whether the facts are certain. If these two conditions
have been obeyed, the principles follow by an inevitable
inference. Their demonstration is, in the present
volume, necessarily incomplete; and the reader must
suspend his final judgment until the close of this Introduction,
when the subject in all its bearings will be laid
before him. The remaining part of the Introduction
will be occupied, as I have already intimated, with an
investigation of the civilizations of Germany, America,
Scotland, and Spain; each of which presents a different
type of intellectual development, and has, therefore,
followed a different direction in its religious, scientific,
social, and political history. The causes of these differences
I shall attempt to ascertain. The next step will
be to generalize the causes themselves; and having
thus referred them to certain principles common to all,
we shall be possessed of what may be called the fundamental
laws of European thought; the divergence of
the different countries being regulated either by the
direction those laws take, or else by their comparative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
energy. To discover these fundamental laws will be
the business of the Introduction; while, in the body of
the work, I shall apply them to the history of England,
and endeavour by their aid to work out the epochs
through which we have successively passed, fix the
basis of our present civilization, and indicate the path
of our future progress.</p>

Calvinism is &lsquo;a system of all others the least attractive to the

intelligent observer, who travelled all through Germany, remarked, in
1780, that the Calvinists, though richer than their opponents, had less
taste for the arts. <i>Riesbeck's Travels through Germany</i>, London, 1787,

learning, particularly of patristic learning; but the most profound
thinkers have been on the other side, as in the instances of Augustin,
Pascal, and Jonathan Edwards. To these Calvinistic metaphysicians the
Arminian party can oppose no one of equal ability; and it is remarkable,
that the Jesuits, by far the most zealous Arminians in the Romish
Church, have always been celebrated for their erudition, but have paid
so little attention to the study of the mind, that, as Sir James
Mackintosh says (<i>Dissert. on Ethical Philos.</i> p. 185), Buffier is &lsquo;the
only Jesuit whose name has a place in the history of abstract
philosophy.&rsquo; And it is interesting to observe, that this superiority of
thought on the part of the Calvinists, accompanied by an inferiority of
learning, existed from the beginning; for Neander (<i>History of the
Church</i>, vol. iv. p. 299) remarks, that Pelagius &lsquo;was not possessed of
the profound speculative spirit which we find in Augustin,&rsquo; but that &lsquo;in
learning he was Augustin's superior.&rsquo;</p></div>

foreknowledge, has been supported by theologians of the Calvinistic
school, more or less rigidly, throughout the whole of the present
century.&rsquo; <i>Morell's Speculative Philosophy of Europe</i>, 1846, vol. i. p.
366. Indeed, this tendency is so natural, that we find the doctrine of
necessity, or something extremely like it, laid down by Augustin. See
the interesting extracts in <i>Neander's History of the Church</i>, vol. vi.
pp. 424, 425; where, however, a loophole is left to let in the idea of
interference, or at all events of superintendence.</p></div>

existence of matter without properties which give rise to forces (note
in <i>Paget's Lectures on Pathology</i>, 1853, vol. i. p. 61), there are two
reasons which prevent me from attaching much weight to it. First, a
conception which, in one stage of knowledge, is called impossible,
becomes, in a later stage, perfectly easy, and so natural as to be often
termed necessary. Secondly, however indissoluble the connexion may
appear between force and matter, it was not found fatal to the dynamical
theory of Leibnitz; it has not prevented other eminent thinkers from
holding similar views; and the arguments of Berkeley, though constantly
attacked, have never been refuted.</p></div>

palæontological science.&rsquo; <i>Owen on Fossil Mammalia</i>, in <i>Report of Brit.

him entirely new views of the theory of the earth.&rsquo; p. 209. See also
<i>Bakewell's Geology</i>, p. 368; and <i>Milne Edwards</i>, <i>Zoologie</i>, part ii.
p. 279. The importance of this step is becoming more evident every year;
and it has been justly remarked, that without palæontology there would
be, properly speaking, no geology. <i>Balfour's Botany</i>, 1849, p. 591. Sir
R. Murchison (<i>Siluria</i>, 1854, p. 366) says, &lsquo;it is essentially the
study of organic remains which has led to the clear subdivision of the
vast mass of older rocks, which were there formerly merged under the
unmeaning term &ldquo;Grauwacke.&rdquo;&rsquo; In the same able work, p. 465, we are told
that, &lsquo;in surveying the whole series of formations, the practical
geologist is fully impressed with the conviction that there has, at all
periods, subsisted a very intimate connexion between the existence, or,
at all events, the preservation of animals, and the media in which they
have been fossilized.&rsquo; For an instance of this in the old red sandstone,
see p. 329.</p></div>

<i>Murchison's Siluria</i>, pp. 466, 467; and <i>Strickland on Ornithology</i>, p.
210 (<i>Brit. Assoc. for</i> 1844). So, too, in the vegetable kingdom, many
of the plants in the tertiary strata belong to genera still existing;
but this is rarely the case with the secondary strata; while in the
primary strata, even the families are different to those now found on
the earth. <i>Balfour's Botany</i>, pp. 592, 593. Compare Wilson's additions
to <i>Jussieu's Botany</i>, 1849, p. 746; and for further illustration of
this remarkable law of the relation between advancing time and
diminished similarity, a law suggesting the most curious speculations,

respecting the opinions formerly held on these subjects. Among other
instances, he mentions a learned man named Henrion, an academician, and,
I suppose, a theologian, who in 1718 published a work, in which &lsquo;il
assignait à Adam cent vingt-trois pieds neuf pouces;&rsquo; Noah being twenty

Sir Charles Lyell says (<i>Principles of Geology</i>, p. 60), his own
discoveries supplied the means of overthrowing it, and of familiarizing
us with the idea of continuity. Indeed it was one of the fossil
observations of Cuvier which first supplied the link between reptiles,
fishes, and cetaceous mammals. See <i>Owen on Fossil Reptiles</i>, pp. 60,
198, <i>Brit. Assoc. for</i> 1841; and compare <i>Carus's Comparative Anatomy</i>,
vol. i. p. 155. To this I may add, that Cuvier unconsciously prepared
the way for disturbing the old dogma of fixity of species, though he
himself clung to it to the last. See some observations, which are very
remarkable, considering the period when they were written, in <i>Cabanis</i>,
<i>Rapports du Physique et du Moral</i>, pp. 427, 428: conclusions drawn from
Cuvier, which Cuvier would have himself rejected.</p></div>

the possibility of generalizing the past, so as to predict the future;
while as to Voltaire, the weakest point in his otherwise profound view
of history was his love of the old saying, that great events spring from
little causes; a singular error for so comprehensive a mind, because it
depended on confusing causes with conditions. That a man like Voltaire
should have committed what now seems so gross a blunder, is a mortifying
reflection for those who are able to appreciate his vast and penetrating
genius, and it may teach the best of us a wholesome lesson. This fallacy
was avoided by Montesquieu and Turgot; and the former writer, in
particular, displayed such extraordinary ability, that there can be
little doubt, that had he lived at a later period, and thus had the
means of employing in their full extent the resources of political
economy and physical science, he would have had the honour not only of
laying the basis, but also of rearing the structure of the philosophy of
the history of Man. As it was, he failed in conceiving what is the final
object of every scientific inquiry, namely, the power of foretelling the
future: and after his death, in 1755, all the finest intellects in
France, Voltaire alone excepted, concentrated their attention upon the
study of natural phenomena.</p></div>

Carus (<i>Comparative Anatomy</i>, vol. ii. p. 356) and by Sir Benjamin
Brodie (<i>Lectures on Pathology and Surgery</i>, p. 6) comes nearly to the
same thing, though expressed with less precision. On the other hand, M.
Milne Edwards (<i>Zoologie</i>, part i. p. 9) calls physiology &lsquo;la science de

at all, for there certainly is at present no science of life.</p></div>

de Cuvier</i>, pp. 69, 70), that it was in, or just after, 1791, that the
dissection of some mollusca suggested to him the idea of reforming the
classification of the whole animal kingdom. Compare <i>Cuvier</i>, <i>Règne

arrangement has proceeded from the advocates of the doctrine of circular
progression: a remarkable theory, of which Lamarck and Macleay are the
real originators, and which is certainly supported by a considerable
amount of evidence. Still, among the great majority of competent
zoologists, the fourfold division holds its ground, although the
constantly-increasing accuracy of microscopical observations has
detected a nervous system much lower in the scale than was formerly
suspected, and has thereby induced some anatomists to divide the radiata
into acrita and nematoneura. <i>Owen's Invertebrata</i>, 1855, pp. 14, 15;
and <i>Rymer Jones's Animal Kingdom</i>, 1855, p. 4. As, however, it seems
probable that all animals have a distinct nervous system, this
subdivision is only provisional; and it is very likely that when our
microscopes are more improved, we shall have to return to Cuvier's
arrangement. Some of Cuvier's successors have removed the apodous
echinoderms from the radiata; but in this Mr. Rymer Jones (<i>Animal
Kingdom</i>, p. 211) vindicates the Cuverian classification.</p></div>

l'anatomie humaine;&rsquo; and at p. 350, &lsquo;quand on ne considère que ce qui se
passe chez l'homme, ainsi que l'a fait Bichat.&rsquo; This, however, is much
too positively stated. Bichat mentions &lsquo;les expériences nombreuses que
j'ai faites sur les animaux vivans.&rsquo; <i>Bichat</i>, <i>Anatomie Générale</i>, vol.
i. p. 332; and for other instances of his experiments on animals below
man, see the same work, vol. i. pp. 164, 284, 311, 312, 326, vol. ii.

201, 224. These are all experiments on inferior animals, which aided
this great physiologist in establishing those vast generalizations,
which, though applied to man, were by no means collected merely from
human anatomy. The impossibility of understanding physiology without
studying comparative anatomy, is well pointed out in Mr. Rymer Jones's
work, <i>Organization of the Animal Kingdom</i>, 1855, pp. 601, 791.</p></div>

p. 170) complains, strangely enough, that Cuvier &lsquo;rejects the more plain
and obvious characters which every one can see, and which had been so
happily employed by Linnæus, and makes the differences between these
groups to depend upon circumstances which no one but an anatomist can
understand.&rsquo; See also p. 173: &lsquo;characters which, however good, are not
always comprehensible, except to the anatomist.&rsquo; (Compare <i>Hodgson on
the Ornithology of Nepal</i>, in <i>Asiatic Researches</i>, vol. xix. p. 179,
Calcutta, 1836.) In other words, this is a complaint that Cuvier
attempted to raise zoology to a science, and, therefore, of course,
deprived it of some of its popular attractions, in order to invest it
with other attractions of a far higher character. The errors introduced
into the natural sciences by relying upon observation instead of
experiment, have been noticed by many writers; and by none more
judiciously than M. Saint Hilaire in his <i>Anomalies de l'Organisation</i>,
vol. i. p. 98.</p></div>

works of Smyth, Bonn, or Fallopius, and I do not remember that he any
where even mentions their names. He had, however, certainly studied
Bordeu; but I suspect that the author by whom he was most influenced was
Pinel, whose pathological generalizations were put forward just about
the time when Bichat began to write. Compare <i>Bichat</i>, <i>Traité des
Membranes</i>, pp. 3, 4, 107, 191; <i>Béclard</i>, <i>Anat. Gén.</i> pp. 65, 66;

vol. i. p. 49. At p. 50 he says, &lsquo;en effet, quel que soit le point de
vue sous lequel on considère ces tissus, ils ne se ressemblent
nullement: c'est la nature, et non la science, qui a tiré une ligne de
démarcation entre eux.&rsquo; There is, however, now reason to think, that
both animal and vegetable tissues are, in all their varieties,
referrible to a cellular origin. This great view, which M. Schwann
principally worked out, will, if fully established, be the largest
generalization we possess respecting the organic world, and it would be
difficult to overrate its value. Still there is danger lest, in
prematurely reaching at so vast a law, we should neglect the
subordinate, but strongly-marked differences between the tissues as they
actually exist. Burdach (<i>Traité de Physiologie</i>, vol. vi. pp. 195, 196)
has made some good remarks on the confusion introduced into the study of
tissues, by neglecting those salient characteristics which were
indicated by Bichat.</p></div>

necessarily polluted atmosphere, he laid the foundation for that
diseased habit which caused a slight accident to prove fatal, and
carried him off at the age of thirty-one. &lsquo;L'esprit a peine à concevoir

called), which before his time scarcely existed, Bichat attached great
importance, and clearly saw that it would eventually become of the
utmost value for pathology. <i>Anat. Gén.</i> vol. i. pp. 331, 332, vol. ii.
pp. 234&ndash;241, vol. iv. p. 417, &amp;c. Unfortunately these investigations
were not properly followed up by his immediate successors; and Müller,
writing long after his death, was obliged to refer chiefly to Bichat for
&lsquo;the true principles of general pathology.&rsquo; <i>Müller's Physiology</i>, 1840,
vol. i. p. 808. M. Vogel too, in his <i>Pathological Anatomy</i>, 1847, pp.
398, 413, notices the error committed by the earlier pathologists, in
looking at changes in the organs, and neglecting those in the tissues;
and the same remark is made in <i>Robin et Verdeil</i>, <i>Chimie Anatomique</i>,
1853, vol. i. p. 45; and in <i>Henle</i>, <i>Traité d'Anatomie</i>, vol. i. p.
vii., Paris, 1843. That &lsquo;structural anatomy,&rsquo; and &lsquo;structural
development,&rsquo; are to be made the foundations of pathology, is, moreover,
observed in <i>Simon's Pathology</i>, 1850, p. 115 (compare <i>Williams's
Principles of Medicine</i>, 1848, p. 67), who ascribes the chief merit of
this &lsquo;rational pathology&rsquo; to Henle and Schwann: omitting to mention that
they only executed Bichat's scheme and (be it said
with every respect for these eminent men) executed it with a
comprehensiveness much inferior to that displayed by their great
predecessor. In <i>Broussais</i>, <i>Examen des Doctrines Médicales</i>, vol. iv.
pp. 106, 107, there are some just and liberal observations on the
immense service which Bichat rendered to pathology. See also <i>Béclard</i>,

<p>In consequence of this movement, there has sprung up, under the name of

which, I believe, no instance will be found before the time of Bichat,
but the value of which is now recognized by most pathologists. Compare

doctrine, until the discovery of their tubes, in 1835, by Purkinjé.

tubular structure; but no one believed what he said, and Purkinjé was
unacquainted with his researches. Compare <i>Nasmyth's Researches on the

distinctly confines himself to &lsquo;one of the primary divisions of the

application to it of generalizations from some other subject, so as to
widen the field of thought. To call this a new method, is rather vague;
but there is no other word to express the process. Properly speaking,
there are only two methods, the inductive and the deductive; which,
though essentially different, are so mixed together, as to make it
impossible wholly to separate them. The discussion of the real nature of
this difference I reserve for my comparison, in the next volume, of the
German and American civilizations.</p></div>

Maistre were certainly the most eloquent, and were probably the most
influential leaders of this reaction. Neither of them liked induction,
but preferred reasoning deductively from premises which they assumed,
and which they called first principles. De Maistre, however, was a
powerful dialectician, and on that account his works are read by many
who care nothing for the gorgeous declamation of Chateaubriand. In
metaphysics, a precisely similar movement occurred; and Laromiguière,
Royer Collard, and Maine de Biran, founded that celebrated school which
culminated in M. Cousin, and which is equally characterized by an
ignorance of the philosophy of induction, and by a want of sympathy with
physical science.</p></div>

entre les organes des deux vies, savoir, que la nature se livre bien
plus rarement à des écarts de conformation dans la vie animale que dans
la vie organique&hellip;. C'est une remarque qui n'a pu échapper à celui dont
les dissections ont été un peu multipliées, que les fréquentes
variations de formes, de grandeur, de position, de direction des organes
internes, comme la rate, le foie, l'estomac, les reins, les organes
salivaires, etc&hellip;. Jetons maintenant les yeux sur les organes de la vie
animale, sur les sens, les nerfs, le cerveau, les muscles volontaires,
le larynx; tout y est exact, précis, rigoureusement déterminé dans la
forme, la grandeur et la position. On n'y voit presque jamais de
variétés, de conformation; s'il en existe, les fonctions sont troublées,
anéanties; tandis qu'elles restent les mêmes dans la vie organique, au
milieu des altérations diverses des parties.&rsquo; <i>Bichat sur la Vie</i>, pp.
23&ndash;25. Part of this view is corroborated by the evidence collected
by Saint Hilaire (<i>Anomalies de l'Organisation</i>, vol. i. pp. 248 seq.)
of the extraordinary aberrations to which the vegetative organs are
liable; and he mentions (vol. ii. p. 8) the case of a man, in whose body,
on dissection, &lsquo;on reconnut que tous les viscères étaient transposés.&rsquo;
Comparative anatomy supplies another illustration. The bodies of
mollusca are less symmetrical than those of articulata; and in the
former, the &lsquo;vegetal series of organs,&rsquo; says Mr. Owen, are more
developed than the animal series; while in the articulata, &lsquo;the advance
is most conspicuous in the organs peculiar to animal life.&rsquo; <i>Owen's
Invertebrata</i>, p. 470. Compare <i>Burdach's Physiologie</i>, vol. i. pp. 153,
189; and a confirmation of the &lsquo;unsymmetrical&rsquo; organs of the gasterpoda,
in <i>Grant's Comparative Anatomy</i>, p. 461. This curious antagonism is
still further seen in the circumstance, that idiots, whose functions of
nutrition and of excretion are often very active, are at the same time
remarkable for a want of symmetry in the organs of sensation.
<i>Esquirol</i>, <i>Maladies Mentales</i>, vol. ii. pp. 331, 332.</p>

<p>A result, though perhaps an unconscious one, of the application and
extension of these ideas, is, that within the last few years there has
arisen a pathological theory of what are called &lsquo;symmetrical diseases,&rsquo;
the leading facts of which have been long known, but are now only
beginning to be generalized. See <i>Paget's Pathology</i>, vol. i. pp. 18&ndash;22,

begins after birth; but surely this must be very doubtful. Few
physiologists will deny that embryological phenomena, though neglected
by metaphysicians, play a great part in shaping the future character;
and I do not see how any system of psychology can be complete which
ignores considerations, probable in themselves, and not refuted by
special evidence. So carelessly, however, has this subject been
investigated, that we have the most conflicting statements respecting
even the <i>vagitus uterinus</i>, which, if it exists to the extent alleged
by some physiologists, would be a decisive proof that animal life (in
the sense of Bichat) does begin during the f&oelig;tal period. Compare

(<i>Winckler</i>, <i>Geschichte der Botanik</i>, 1854, pp. 34, 40); but, according

Whewell, in his <i>Bridgewater Treatise</i>, p. 247, says, &lsquo;about 10,000.&rsquo;)
Since then the progress has been uninterrupted; and in <i>Henslow's

known and classified in works of botany amounts to about 60,000.&rsquo; Ten
years later, Dr. Lindley (<i>Vegetable Kingdom</i>, 1847, p. 800) states them
at 92,930; and two years afterwards, Mr. Balfour says &lsquo;about 100,000.&rsquo;
<i>Balfour's Botany</i>, 1849, p. 560. Such is the rate at which our
knowledge of nature is advancing. To complete this historical note, I
ought to have mentioned, that in 1812, Dr. Thomson says &lsquo;nearly 30,000
species of plants have been examined and described.&rsquo; <i>Thomson's Hist. of

being unnatural, they are strictly natural. A fresh science has thus

the Linnæan system long after the superiority of a natural system was
proved. This is the more noticeable, because Linnæus, who was a man of
undoubted genius, and who possessed extraordinary powers of combination,
always allowed that his own system was merely provisional, and that the
great object to be attained was a classification according to natural
families. See <i>Winckler</i>, <i>Geschichte der Botanik</i>, p. 202; and
<i>Richard</i>, <i>Eléments de Botanique</i>, p. 570. Indeed, what could be
thought of the permanent value of a scheme which put together the reed
and the barberry, because they were both hexandria; and forced sorrel to
associate with saffron, because both were trigynia? <i>Jussieu's Botany</i>,

Paris in 1789; and, though it is known to have been the result of many
years of continued labour, some writers have asserted that the ideas in
it were borrowed from his uncle, Bernard Jussieu. But assertions of this
kind rarely deserve attention; and as Bernard did not choose to publish
anything of his own, his reputation ought to suffer for his
uncommunicativeness. Compare <i>Winckler</i>, <i>Gesch. der Botanik</i>, pp.

following remarks from a work of authority, <i>Richard</i>, <i>Eléments de
Botanique</i>, Paris, 1846, p. 572: &lsquo;Mais ce ne fut qu'en 1789 que l'on eut
véritablement un ouvrage complet sur la méthode des familles naturelles.
Le <i>Genera Plantarum</i> d'A. L. de Jussieu présenta la science des
végétaux sous un point de vue si nouveau, par la précision et l'élégance
qui y règnent, par la profondeur et la justesse des principes généraux
qui y sont exposés pour la première fois, que c'est depuis cette époque
seulement que la méthode des familles naturelles a été véritablement
créée, et que date la nouvelle ère de la science des
végétaux&hellip;. L'auteur du <i>Genera Plantarum</i> posa le premier les bases de
la science, en faisant voir quelle était l'importance relative des
différents organes entre eux, et par conséquent leur valeur dans la
classification&hellip;. Il a fait, selon la remarque de Cuvier, la même
révolution dans les sciences d'observation que la chimie de Lavoisier
dans les sciences d'expérience. En effet, il a non seulement changé la
face de la botanique; mais son influence s'est également exercée sur les
autres branches de l'histoire naturelle, et y a introduit cet esprit de
recherches, de comparaison, et cette méthode philosophique et naturelle,
vers le perfectionnement de laquelle tendent désormais les efforts de
tous les naturalistes.&rsquo;</p></div>

to me to exaggerate their effect upon &lsquo;l'importance des formes

arrangement, because our implements for measuring the minute angles of
crystals are still very imperfect, and the goniometer may fail in
detecting differences which really exist; and, therefore, many alleged
cases of isomorphism are probably not so in reality. Wollaston's
reflecting goniometer has been long considered the best instrument
possessed by crystallographers; but I learn from <i>Liebig and Kopp's
Reports</i>, vol. i. pp. 19, 20, that Frankenheim has recently invented one
for measuring the angles of &lsquo;microscopic crystals.&rsquo; On the amount of

formes cristallines, tandis qu'il n'en est aucune qu'on ne puisse, avec
un peu d'attention rapporter à la figure élémentaire et primordiale dont
elle dérive.&rsquo; Even Buffon, notwithstanding his fine perception of law,
had just declared, &lsquo;qu'en général la forme de cristallisation n'est pas
un caractère constant, mais plus équivoque et plus variable qu'aucun
autre des caractères par lesquels on doit distinguer les minéraux.&rsquo; <i>De
Lisle</i>, vol. i. p. xviii. Compare, on this great achievement of De
Lisle's, <i>Herschel's Nat. Philos.</i> p. 239: &lsquo;he first ascertained the
important fact of the constancy of the angles at which their faces
meet.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1133_1133" id="Footnote_1133_1133"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1133_1133"><span class="label">[1133]</span></a> The first work of Haüy appeared in 1784 (<i>Quérard</i>,
<i>France Littéraire</i>, vol. iv. p. 41); but he had read two special
memoirs in 1781. <i>Cuvier</i>, <i>Eloges</i>, vol. iii. p. 138. The intellectual
relation between his views and those of his predecessor must be obvious
to every mineralogist; but Dr. Whewell, who has noticed this judiciously
enough, adds (<i>Hist. of the Induc. Sciences</i>, vol. iii. pp. 229, 230):
&lsquo;Unfortunately Romé de Lisle and Haüy were not only rivals, but in some
measure enemies&hellip;. Haüy revenged himself by rarely mentioning Romé in
his works, though it was manifest that his obligations to him were
immense; and by recording his errors while he corrected them.&rsquo; The
truth, however, is, that so far from rarely mentioning De Lisle, he
mentions him incessantly; and I have counted upwards of three hundred
instances in Haüy's great work, in which he is named, and his writings
are referred to. On one occasion he says of De Lisle, &lsquo;En un mot, sa
cristallographie est le fruit d'un travail immense par son étendue,
presque entièrement neuf par son objet, et très-précieux par son
utilité.&rsquo; <i>Haüy</i>, <i>Traité de Minéralogie</i>, Paris, 1801, vol. i. p. 17.
Elsewhere he calls him, &lsquo;cet habile naturaliste; ce savant célèbre,&rsquo;
vol. ii. p. 323; &lsquo;ce célèbre naturaliste,&rsquo; vol. iii. p. 442; see also
vol. iv. pp. 51, &amp;c. In a work of so much merit as Dr. Whewell's, it is
important that these errors should be indicated, because we have no
other book of value on the general history of the sciences; and many
authors have deceived themselves and their readers, by implicitly
adopting the statements of this able and industrious writer. I would
particularly caution the student in regard to the physiological part of
Dr. Whewell's History, where, for instance, the antagonism between the
methods of Cuvier and Bichat is entirely lost sight of, and while whole
pages are devoted to Cuvier, Bichat is disposed of in four lines.</p></div>

excited much attention among his hearers, was indebted for some of his

the laws of symmetry, and then apply them deductively to minerals,
instead of rising inductively from the aberrations actually presented by
minerals. This is interesting to observe, because it is analogous to the
method of the best pathologists, who seek the philosophy of their
subject in physiological phenomena, rather than in pathological ones;
striking downwards from the normal to the abnormal. &lsquo;<i>La symétrie des

expresses the modern and purely scientific view, says in his great work
(<i>Des Maladies Mentaes</i>, Paris, 1838, vol. i. p. 336), &lsquo;L'aliénation
mentale, que les anciens peuples regardaient comme une inspiration ou
une punition des dieux, qui dans la suite fut prise pour la possession

innombrables, ne diffère en rien des autres maladies.&rsquo; The recognition
of this he expressly ascribes to his predecessor: &lsquo;grâce aux principes

between his own opinions and the spirit of the age: see <i>Pinel</i>, <i>Traité

by Townsend, who visited France in 1786, on his way to Spain: &lsquo;A

(<i>Correspondence</i>, vol. ii. p. 224): &lsquo;In society, the <i>habit habillé</i> is
almost banished, and they begin to go even to great suppers in frock: the
court and diplomatic corps, however, must always be excepted. They are
too high to be reached by any improvement. They are the last refuge from
which etiquette, formality, and folly will be driven. Take away these,
and they would be on a level with other people.&rsquo; Jefferson was a
statesman and a diplomatist, and was well acquainted with his profession.
The change, however, which he noticed, had been coming on some years
earlier. In a letter written in May 1786, it is said: &lsquo;Il est rare
aujourd'hui de rencontrer dans le monde des personnes qui soient ce qu'on
appelle habillées. Lee femmes sont en chemise et en chapeau, les hommes
en froc et en gilet.&rsquo; <i>Grimm</i>, <i>Correspond.</i> vol. xiv. p. 485; and on the
increased simplicity of attire in 1780, see vol. xi. pp. 141, 142. Ségur,
who witnessed these changes, and was much displeased by them, says of
their advocates, &lsquo;ils ne voyaient pas que les frocs, remplaçant les
amples et imposans vêtemens de l'ancienne cour, présagaient un penchant
général pour l'égalité.&rsquo; <i>Mém. de Ségur</i>, vol. i. p. 131. Soulavie
(<i>Règne de Louis XVI</i>, vol. vi. p. 38) observes, that &lsquo;les grands, vers
les approches de la révolution, n'avoient plus que des habits simples et
peu coûteux;&rsquo; and that &lsquo;on ne distingua plus une duchesse d'une actrice,&rsquo;
p. 43: see also an extract from Montjoye, in <i>Alison's History</i>, vol. i.

distinctives sous le froc le plus simple, qui leur permettait de courir
à pied dans les rues et de se confondre dans la foule.&rsquo; <i>Mém. de
Montbarey</i>, vol. iii. pp. 161, 162. Another alteration of the same
tendency is worth recording. The Baroness d'Oberkirch, who revisited
Paris in 1784, remarked, on her arrival, that &lsquo;gentlemen began about
this time to go about unarmed, and wore swords only in full dress&hellip;.
And thus the French nobility laid aside a usage which the example of
their fathers had consecrated through centuries.&rsquo; <i>D'Oberkirch's

inaperçu, eut dans la suite de grandes, et momentanément de funestes
conséquences. Dans le commencement, son premier résultat fut de séparer

fortes, mais moins aimables: la politique y gagna, la société y perdit.&rsquo;
<i>Mém. de Ségur</i>, vol. ii. p. 28. By the spring of 1786, this separation
of the sexes had become still more marked; and it was a common
complaint, that ladies were obliged to go to the theatre alone, men
being at their clubs. See the very curious observations in <i>Grimm</i>,
<i>Correspond.</i> vol. xiv. pp. 486&ndash;489, where there is also a notice of &lsquo;le

personnes distinguées de la noblesse ou de la haute bourgeoisie, ainsi
que des artistes et des hommes de lettres les plus considérés. Cette
réunion offrait, pour la première fois, l'image d'une égalité qui
devient bientôt, plus que la liberté même, le v&oelig;u le plus ardent de

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">OUTLINE OF THE HISTORY OF THE SPANISH INTELLECT FROM THE
FIFTH TO THE MIDDLE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.</div>

<p>In the preceding chapters, I have endeavoured to establish
four leading propositions, which, according to my view,
are to be deemed the basis of the history of civilization.
They are: 1st, That the progress of mankind depends
on the success with which the laws of phenomena are
investigated, and on the extent to which a knowledge
of those laws is diffused. 2nd, That before such investigation
can begin, a spirit of scepticism must arise,
which, at first aiding the investigation, is afterwards
aided by it. 3rd, That the discoveries thus made, increase
the influence of intellectual truths, and diminish,
relatively not absolutely, the influence of moral truths;
moral truths being more stationary than intellectual
truths, and receiving fewer additions. 4th, That the
great enemy of this movement, and therefore the great
enemy of civilization, is the protective spirit; by which
I mean the notion that society cannot prosper, unless
the affairs of life are watched over and protected at
nearly every turn by the state and the church; the
state teaching men what they are to do, and the church
teaching them what they are to believe. Such are the
propositions which I hold to be the most essential for
a right understanding of history, and which I have defended
in the only two ways any proposition can be
defended; namely, inductively and deductively. The
inductive defence comprises a collection of historical
and scientific facts, which suggest and authorize the
conclusions drawn from them; while the deductive defence
consists of a verification of those conclusions, by
showing how they explain the history of different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
countries and their various fortunes. To the former,
or inductive method of defence, I am at present unable to
add anything new; but the deductive defence I hope to
strengthen considerably, and by the aid of the following
chapters, confirm not only the four cardinal propositions
just stated, but also several minor propositions, which,
though strictly speaking flowing from them, will require
separate verification. According to the plan
already sketched, the remaining part of the introduction
will contain an examination of the history of
Spain, of Scotland, of Germany, and of the United
States of America, with the object of elucidating principles
on which the history of England supplies inadequate
information. And as Spain is the country where
what I conceive to be the fundamental conditions of
national improvement have been most flagrantly violated,
so also shall we find that it is the country where
the penalty paid for the violation has been most heavy,
and where, therefore, it is most instructive to ascertain
how the prevalence of certain opinions causes the decay
of the people among whom they predominate.</p>

<p>We have seen that the old tropical civilizations were
accompanied by remarkable features which I have termed
Aspects of Nature, and which, by inflaming the imagination,
encouraged superstition, and prevented men
from daring to analyze such threatening physical phenomena;
in other words, prevented the creation of the
physical sciences. Now, it is an interesting fact that,
in these respects, no European country is so analogous
to the tropics as Spain. No other part of Europe is so
clearly designated by nature as the seat and refuge of
superstition. Recurring to what has been already
proved,<a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> it will be remembered that among the most
important physical causes of superstition are famines,
epidemics, earthquakes, and that general unhealthiness
of climate, which, by shortening the average duration
of life, increases the frequency and earnestness with
which supernatural aid is invoked. These peculiarities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
taken together, are more prominent in Spain than anywhere
else in Europe; it will therefore be useful to
give such a summary of them as will exhibit the mischievous
effects they have produced in shaping the
national character.</p>

<p>If we except the northern extremity of Spain, we
may say that the two principal characteristics of the
climate are heat and dryness, both of which are favoured
by the extreme difficulty which nature has interposed
in regard to irrigation. For, the rivers which intersect
the land, run mostly in beds too deep to be made available
for watering the soil, which consequently is, and
always has been, remarkably arid.<a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a> Owing to this, and
to the infrequency of rain, there is no European country
as richly endowed in other respects, where droughts
and therefore famines have been so frequent and
serious.<a name="FNanchor_1166_1166" id="FNanchor_1166_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> At the same time the vicissitudes of climate,
particularly in the central parts, make Spain habitually
unhealthy; and this general tendency being
strengthened in the middle ages by the constant occurrence
of famine, caused the ravages of pestilence to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
unusually fatal.<a name="FNanchor_1167_1167" id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> When we moreover add that in the
Peninsula, including Portugal, earthquakes have been
extremely disastrous,<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> and have excited all those superstitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
feelings which they naturally provoke, we may
form some idea of the insecurity of life, and of the ease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
with which an artful and ambitious priesthood could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
turn such insecurity into an engine for the advancement
of their own power.<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>Another feature of this singular country is the prevalence
of a pastoral life, mainly caused by the difficulty
of establishing regular habits of agricultural industry.
In most parts of Spain, the climate renders it impossible
for the labourer to work the whole of the day;<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a>
and this forced interruption encourages among the
people an irregularity and instability of purpose, which
makes them choose the wandering avocations of a shepherd,
rather than the more fixed pursuits of agriculture.<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
And during the long and arduous war which they waged
against their Mohammedan invaders, they were subject
to such incessant surprises and forays on the part of
the enemy, as to make it advisable that their means of
subsistence should be easily removed; hence they preferred
the produce of their flocks to that of their lands,
and were shepherds instead of agriculturists, simply
because by that means they would suffer less in case of
an unfavourable issue. Even after the capture of Toledo,
late in the eleventh century, the inhabitants of the
frontier in Estramadura, La Mancha, and New Castile,
were almost entirely herdsmen, and their cattle were
pastured not in private meadows but in the open
fields.<a name="FNanchor_1172_1172" id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> All this increased the uncertainty of life, and
strengthened that love of adventure, and that spirit of
romance, which, at a later period, gave a tone to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
popular literature. Under such circumstances, everything
grew precarious, restless, and unsettled; thought
and inquiry were impossible; doubt was unknown;
and the way was prepared for those superstitious habits,
and for that deep-rooted and tenacious belief, which
have always formed a principal feature in the history
of the Spanish nation.</p>

<p>To what extent these circumstances would, if they
stood by themselves, have affected the ultimate destiny
of Spain, is a question hardly possible to answer; but
there can be no doubt that their effects must always
have been important, though, from the paucity of evidence,
we are unable to measure them with precision.
In regard, however, to the actual result, this point is of
little moment, because a long chain of other and still
more influential events became interwoven with those
just mentioned, and, tending in precisely the same
direction, produced a combination which nothing could
resist, and from which we may trace with unerring
certainty the steps by which the nation subsequently
declined. The history of the causes of the degradation
of Spain will indeed become too clear to be mistaken, if
studied in reference to those general principles which
I have enunciated, and which will themselves be confirmed
by the light they throw on this instructive
though melancholy subject.</p>

<p>After the subversion of the Roman Empire, the first
leading fact in the history of Spain is the settlement of
the Visigoths, and the establishment of their opinions in
the Peninsula. They, as well as the Suevi, who immediately
preceded them, were Arians, and Spain during
a hundred and fifty years became the rallying point of
that famous heresy,<a name="FNanchor_1173_1173" id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> to which indeed most of the Gothic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
tribes then adhered. But, at the end of the fifth century,
the Franks, on their conversion from Paganism,
adopted the opposite and orthodox creed, and were encouraged
by their clergy to make war upon their heretical
neighbours. Clovis, who was then king of the
Franks, was regarded by the church as the champion
of the faith, in whose behalf he attacked the unbelieving
Visigoths.<a name="FNanchor_1174_1174" id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> His successors, moved by the same
motives, pursued the same policy;<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> and, during nearly
a century, there was a war of opinions between France
and Spain, by which the Visigothic Empire was seriously
endangered, and was more than once on the verge of
dissolution. Hence, in Spain, a war for national independence
became also a war for national religion,<a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
an intimate alliance was formed between the Arian
kings and the Arian clergy. The latter class were, in
those ages of ignorance, sure to gain by such a compact,<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a>
and they received considerable temporal advantages
in return for the prayers which they offered up
against the enemy, as also for the miracles which they
occasionally performed. Thus early a foundation was
laid for the immense influence which the Spanish priesthood
have possessed ever since, and which was strengthened
by subsequent events. For, late in the sixth
century, the Latin clergy converted their Visigothic
masters, and the Spanish government, becoming orthodox,
naturally conferred upon its teachers an authority
equal to that wielded by the Arian hierarchy.<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a> Indeed,
the rulers of Spain, grateful to those who had shown
them the error of their ways, were willing rather to
increase the power of the church than to diminish it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
The clergy took advantage of this disposition; and the
result was, that before the middle of the seventh century
the spiritual classes possessed more influence in
Spain than in any other part of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> The ecclesiastical
synods became not only councils of the church,
but also parliaments of the realm.<a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a> At Toledo, which
was then the capital of Spain, the power of the clergy
was immense, and was so ostentatiously displayed, that
in a council they held there in the year 633, we find the
king literally prostrating himself on the ground before
the bishops;<a name="FNanchor_1181_1181" id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> and half a century later, the ecclesiastical
historian mentions that this humiliating practice
was repeated by another king, having become, he says,
an established custom.<a name="FNanchor_1182_1182" id="FNanchor_1182_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> That this was not a mere
meaningless ceremony, is moreover evident from other
and analogous facts. Exactly the same tendency is seen
in their jurisprudence; since, by the Visigothic code,
any layman, whether plaintiff or defendant, might insist
on his cause being tried not by the temporal magistrate,
but by the bishop of the diocese. Nay, even if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
both parties to the suit were agreed in preferring the
civil tribunal, the bishop still retained the power of revoking
the decision, if in his opinion it was incorrect;
and it was his especial business to watch over the administration
of justice, and to instruct the magistrates
how to perform their duty.<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> Another, and more painful
proof of the ascendency of the clergy, is that the
laws against heretics were harsher in Spain than in any
other country; the Jews in particular being persecuted
with unrelenting rigour.<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a> Indeed, the desire of upholding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
the faith was strong enough to produce a
formal declaration that no sovereign should be acknowledged,
unless he promised to preserve its purity; the
judges of the purity being of course the bishops themselves,
to whose suffrage the king owed his throne.<a name="FNanchor_1185_1185" id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a></p>

<p>Such were the circumstances which, in and before
the seventh century, secured to the Spanish Church an
influence unequalled in any other part of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a>
Early in the eighth century, an event occurred which
apparently broke up and dispersed the hierarchy, but
which in reality was extremely favourable to them. In
711 the Mohammedans sailed from Africa, landed in the
south of Spain, and in the space of three years conquered
the whole country, except the almost inaccessible
regions of the north-west. The Spaniards, secure
in their native mountains,<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a> soon recovered heart, rallied
their forces, and began in their turn to assail the invaders.
A desperate struggle ensued, which lasted
nearly eight centuries, and in which, a second time in
the history of Spain, a war for independence was also a
war for religion; the contest between Arabian Infidels
and Spanish Christians, succeeding that formerly carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
on between the Trinitarians of France and the Arians
of Spain. Slowly, and with infinite difficulty, the Christians
fought their way. By the middle of the ninth
century, they reached the line of the Douro.<a name="FNanchor_1188_1188" id="FNanchor_1188_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> Before
the close of the eleventh century, they conquered as far
as the Tagus, and Toledo, their ancient capital, fell into
their hands in 1085.<a name="FNanchor_1189_1189" id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> Even then much remained to be
done. In the south, the struggle assumed its deadliest
form, and there it was prolonged with such obstinacy,
that it was not until the capture of Malaga in 1487,
and of Granada in 1492, that the Christian empire was
re-established, and the old Spanish monarchy finally
restored.<a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a></p>

<p>The effect of all this on the Spanish character was
most remarkable. During eight successive centuries,
the whole country was engaged in a religious crusade;
and those holy wars which other nations occasionally
waged, were, in Spain, prolonged and continued for
more than twenty generations.<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> The object being not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
only to regain a territory, but also to re-establish a
creed, it naturally happened that the expounders of
that creed assumed a prominent and important position.
In the camp, and in the council-chamber, the voice of
ecclesiastics was heard and obeyed; for as the war
aimed at the propagation of Christianity, it seemed
right that her ministers should play a conspicuous part
in a matter which particularly concerned them.<a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> The
danger to which the country was exposed being moreover
very imminent, those superstitious feelings were
excited which danger is apt to provoke, and to which,
as I have elsewhere shown,<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> the tropical civilizations
owed some of their leading peculiarities. Scarcely were
the Spanish Christians driven from their homes and
forced to take refuge in the north, when this great
principle began to operate. In their mountainous retreat,
they preserved a chest filled with relics of the
saints, the possession of which they valued as their
greatest security.<a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a> This was to them a national standard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
round which they rallied, and by the aid of which
they gained miraculous victories over their infidel opponents.
Looking upon themselves as soldiers of the
cross, their minds became habituated to supernatural
considerations to an extent which we can now hardly
believe, and which distinguished them in this respect
from every other European nation.<a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> Their young men
saw visions, and their old men dreamed dreams.<a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a>
Strange sights were vouchsafed to them from heaven;
on the eve of a battle mysterious portents appeared;
and it was observed that whenever the Mohammedans
violated the tomb of a Christian saint, thunder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
lightning were sent to rebuke the misbelievers, and, if
need be, to punish their audacious invasion.<a name="FNanchor_1197_1197" id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a></p>

<p>Under circumstances like these, the clergy could not
fail to extend their influence; or, we may rather say, the
course of events extended it for them. The Spanish
Christians, pent up for a considerable time in the mountains
of Asturias, and deprived of their former resources,
quickly degenerated, and soon lost the scanty civilization
to which they had attained. Stripped of all their
wealth, and confined to what was comparatively a barren
region, they relapsed into barbarism, and remained, for
at least a century, without arts, or commerce, or literature.<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a>
As their ignorance increased, so also did their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
superstition; while this last, in its turn, strengthened
the authority of their priests. The order of affairs,
therefore, was very natural. The Mohammedan invasion
made the Christians poor; poverty caused ignorance;
ignorance caused credulity; and credulity,
depriving men both of the power and of the desire to
investigate for themselves, encouraged a reverential
spirit, and confirmed those submissive habits, and that
blind obedience to the Church, which form the leading
and most unfortunate peculiarity of Spanish history.</p>

<p>From this it appears, that there were three ways in
which the Mohammedan invasion strengthened the
devotional feelings of the Spanish people. The first
way was by promoting a long and obstinate religious
war; the second was by the presence of constant and
imminent dangers; and the third way was by the
poverty, and therefore the ignorance, which it produced
among the Christians.</p>

<p>These events being preceded by the great Arian war,
and being accompanied and perpetually reinforced by
those physical phenomena which I have indicated as
tending in the same direction, worked with such combined
and accumulative energy, that in Spain the theological
element became not so much a component of the
national character, but rather the character itself. The
ablest and most ambitious of the Spanish kings were
compelled to follow in the general wake; and, despots
though they were, they succumbed to that pressure of
opinions which they believed they were controlling.
The war with Granada, late in the fifteenth century,
was theological far more than temporal; and Isabella,
who made the greatest sacrifices in order to conduct it,
and who in capacity as well as in honesty was superior
to Ferdinand, had for her object not so much the acquisition
of territory as the propagation of the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
faith.<a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> Indeed, any doubts which could be entertained
respecting the purpose of the contest must have been
dissipated by subsequent events. For, scarcely was the
war brought to a close, when Ferdinand and Isabella
issued a decree expelling from the country every Jew
who refused to deny his faith; so that the soil of Spain
might be no longer polluted by the presence of unbelievers.<a name="FNanchor_1200_1200" id="FNanchor_1200_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a>
To make them Christians, or, failing in that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
to exterminate them, was the business of the Inquisition,
which was established in the same reign, and
which before the end of the fifteenth century was in full
operation.<a name="FNanchor_1201_1201" id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> During the sixteenth century, the throne
was occupied by two princes of eminent ability, who
pursued a similar course. Charles V., who succeeded
Ferdinand in 1516, governed Spain for forty years, and
the general character of his administration was the
same as that of his predecessors. In regard to his
foreign policy, his three principal wars were against
France, against the German princes, and against Turkey.
Of these, the first was secular; but the two last were
essentially religious. In the German war, he defended
the church against innovation; and at the battle of
Muhlberg, he so completely humbled the Protestant
princes, as to retard for some time the progress of the
Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_1202_1202" id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a> In his other great war, he, as the champion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
of Christianity against Mohammedanism, consummated
what his grandfather Ferdinand had begun.
Charles defeated and dislodged the Mohammedans in
the east, just as Ferdinand had done in the west; the
repulse of the Turks before Vienna being to the sixteenth
century what the conquest of the Arabs of
Granada was to the fifteenth.<a name="FNanchor_1203_1203" id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a> It was, therefore, with
reason that Charles, at the close of his career, could
boast that he had always preferred his creed to his
country, and that the first object of his ambition had
been to maintain the interests of Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_1204_1204" id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a> The
zeal with which he struggled for the faith, also appears
in his exertions against heresy in the Low Countries.
According to contemporary and competent authorities,
from fifty thousand to a hundred thousand persons
were put to death in the Netherlands during his reign
on account of their religious opinions.<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a> Later inquirers
have doubted the accuracy of this statement,<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> which
is probably exaggerated; but we know that, between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
1520 and 1550, he published a series of laws, to the
effect that those who were convicted of heresy should
be beheaded, or burned alive, or buried alive. The
penalties were thus various, to meet the circumstances
of each case. Capital punishment, however, was always
to be inflicted on whoever bought an heretical book, or
sold it, or even copied it for his own use.<a name="FNanchor_1207_1207" id="FNanchor_1207_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a> His last
advice to his son, well accorded with these measures.
Only a few days before his death, he signed a codicil to
his will, recommending that no favour should ever be
shown to heretics; that they should all be put to death;
and that care should be taken to uphold the Inquisition,
as the best means of accomplishing so desirable an
end.<a name="FNanchor_1208_1208" id="FNanchor_1208_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>

<p>This barbarous policy is to be ascribed, not to the
vices, nor to the temperament of the individual ruler,
but to the operation of large general causes, which
acted upon the individual, and impelled him to the
course he pursued. Charles was by no means a vindictive
man; his natural disposition was to mercy
rather than to rigour; his sincerity is unquestionable;
he performed what he believed to be his duty; and he
was so kind a friend, that those who knew him best
were precisely those who loved him most.<a name="FNanchor_1209_1209" id="FNanchor_1209_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a> Little,
however, could all that avail in shaping his public
conduct. He was obliged to obey the tendencies of the
age and country in which he lived. And what those
tendencies were, appeared still more clearly after his
death, when the throne of Spain was occupied upwards
of forty years by a prince who inherited it in the prime
of life, and whose reign is particularly interesting as a
symptom and a consequence of the disposition of the
people over whom he ruled.</p>

<p>Philip II., who succeeded Charles V. in 1555, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
indeed eminently a creature of the time, and the ablest
of his biographers aptly terms him the most perfect
type of the national character.<a name="FNanchor_1210_1210" id="FNanchor_1210_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> His favourite maxim,
which forms the key to his policy, was, &lsquo;That it is
better not to reign at all than to reign over heretics.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_1211_1211" id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a>
Armed with supreme power, he bent all his energies
towards carrying this principle into effect. Directly
that he heard that the Protestants were making converts
in Spain, he strained every nerve to stifle the
heresy;<a name="FNanchor_1212_1212" id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a> and so admirably was he seconded by the
general temper of the people, that he was able without
risk to suppress opinions which convulsed every other
part of Europe. In Spain, the Reformation, after a
short struggle, died completely away, and in about ten
years the last vestige of it disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_1213_1213" id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> The Dutch
wished to adopt, and in many instances did adopt, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
reformed doctrine; therefore Philip waged against
them a cruel war, which lasted thirty years, and which
he continued till his death, because he was resolved to
extirpate the new creed.<a name="FNanchor_1214_1214" id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a> He ordered that every
heretic who refused to recant should be burned. If
the heretic did recant, some indulgence was granted;
but having once been tainted, he must die. Instead of
being burned, he was therefore to be executed.<a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a> Of
the number of those who actually suffered in the Low
Countries, we have no precise information;<a name="FNanchor_1216_1216" id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> but Alva
triumphantly boasted that, in the five or six years of
his administration, he had put to death in cold blood
more than eighteen thousand, besides a still greater
number whom he had slain on the field of battle.<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a>
This, even during his short tenure of power, would
make about forty thousand victims; an estimate probably
not far from the truth, since we know, from other
sources, that in one year more than eight thousand were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
either executed or burned.<a name="FNanchor_1218_1218" id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a> Such measures were the
result of instructions issued by Philip, and formed a
necessary part of his general scheme.<a name="FNanchor_1219_1219" id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a> The desire
paramount in his mind, and to which he sacrificed all
other considerations, was to put down the new creed,
and to reinstate the old one. To this, even his immense
ambition and his inordinate love of power were subordinate.
He aimed at the empire of Europe, because he
longed to restore the authority of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_1220_1220" id="FNanchor_1220_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> All
his policy, all his negotiations, all his wars, pointed to
this one end. Soon after his accession, he concluded
an ignominious treaty with the Pope, that it might not
be said that he bore arms against the head of the Christian
world.<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> And his last great enterprise, in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
respects the most important of all, was to fit out, at an
incredible cost, that famous Armada with which he
hoped to humble England, and to nip the heresy of
Europe in its bud, by depriving the Protestants of their
principal support, and of the only asylum where they
were sure to find safe and honourable refuge.<a name="FNanchor_1222_1222" id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a></p>

<p>While Philip, following the course of his predecessors,
was wasting the blood and treasure of Spain in
order to propagate religious opinions,<a name="FNanchor_1223_1223" id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a> the people, instead
of rebelling against so monstrous a system, acquiesced
in it, and cordially sanctioned it. Indeed, they
not only sanctioned it, but they almost worshipped the
man by whom it was enforced. There probably never
lived a prince who, during so long a period, and amid
so many vicissitudes of fortune, was adored by his subjects
as Philip II. was. In evil report, and in good
report, the Spaniards clung to him with unshaken
loyalty. Their affection was not lessened, either by his
reverses, or by his forbidding deportment, or by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
cruelty, or by his grievous exactions. In spite of all,
they loved him to the last. Such was his absurd arrogance,
that he allowed none, not even the most powerful
nobles, to address him, except on their knees, and, in
return, he only spoke in half sentences, leaving them to
guess the rest, and to fulfil his commands as best they
might.<a name="FNanchor_1224_1224" id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a> And ready enough they were to obey his
slightest wishes. A contemporary of Philip, struck by
the universal homage which he received, says that the
Spanish did &lsquo;not merely love, not merely reverence,
but absolutely adore him, and deem his commands so
sacred, that they could not be violated without offence
to God.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_1225_1225" id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>That a man like Philip II., who never possessed a
friend, and whose usual demeanour was of the most
repulsive kind, a harsh master, a brutal parent, a bloody
and remorseless ruler,&mdash;that he should be thus reverenced
by a nation among whom he lived, and who had
their eyes constantly on his actions; that this should
have happened, is surely one of the most surprising,
and, at first sight, one of the most inexplicable facts in
modern history. Here we have a king who, though
afflicted by every quality most calculated to excite terror
and disgust, is loved far more than he is feared, and is
the idol of a very great people during a very long reign.
This is so remarkable as to deserve our serious attention;
and in order to clear up the difficulty, it will be
necessary to inquire into the causes of that spirit of
loyalty which, during several centuries, has distinguished
the Spaniards above every other European
people.</p>

<p>One of the leading causes was undoubtedly the immense
influence possessed by the clergy. For the
maxims inculcated by that powerful body have a natural
tendency to make the people reverence their princes
more than they would otherwise do. And that there
is a real and practical connexion between loyalty and
superstition, appears from the historical fact that the
two feelings have nearly always flourished together and
decayed together. Indeed, this is what we should expect
on mere speculative grounds, seeing that both
feelings are the product of those habits of veneration
which make men submissive in their conduct and credulous
in their belief.<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a> Experience, therefore, as well as
reason, points to this as a general law of the mind,
which, in its operation, may be occasionally disturbed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
but which holds good in a large majority of cases.
Probably the only instance in which the principle fails
is, when a despotic government so misunderstands its
own interests as to offend the clergy, and separate itself
from them. Whenever this is done, a struggle will
arise between loyalty and superstition; the first being
upheld by the political classes, the other by the spiritual
classes. Such a warfare was exhibited in Scotland;
but history does not afford many examples of it, and
certainly it never took place in Spain, where, on the
contrary, several circumstances occurred to cement the
union between the Crown and the Church, and to accustom
the people to look up to both with almost equal
reverence.</p>

<p>By far the most important of these circumstances
was the great Arab invasion, which drove the Christians
into a corner of Spain, and reduced them to such
extremities, that nothing but the strictest discipline,
and the most unhesitating obedience to their leaders,
could have enabled them to make head against their
enemies. Loyalty to their princes became not merely
expedient, but necessary; for if the Spaniards had
been disunited, they would, in the face of the fearful
odds against which they fought, have had no chance
of preserving their national existence. The long war
which ensued, being both political and religious, caused
an intimate alliance between the political and religious
classes, since the kings and the clergy had an equal
interest in driving the Mohammedans from Spain.
During nearly eight centuries, this compact between
Church and State was a necessity forced upon the
Spaniards by the peculiarities of their position; and,
after the necessity had subsided, it naturally happened
that the association of ideas survived the original
danger, and that an impression had been made upon the
popular mind which it was hardly possible to efface.</p>

<p>Evidence of this impression, and of the unrivalled
loyalty it produced, crowds upon us at every turn. In no
other country are the old ballads so numerous and so
intimately connected with the national history. It has,
however, been observed, that their leading characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
is the zeal with which they inculcate obedience and
devotion to princes, and that from this source, even
more than from military achievements, they draw their
most favourite examples of virtue.<a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> In literature the
first great manifestation of the Spanish mind was the
poem of <i>The Cid</i>, written at the end of the twelfth
century, in which we find fresh proof of that extraordinary
loyalty which circumstances had forced upon
the people.<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a> The ecclesiastical councils display a similar
tendency; for, notwithstanding a few exceptions,
no other church has been equally eager in upholding
the rights of kings.<a name="FNanchor_1229_1229" id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a> In civil legislation, we see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
same principle at work; it being asserted, on high
authority, that in no system of laws is loyalty carried
to such extreme height as in the Spanish codes.<a name="FNanchor_1230_1230" id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a> Even
their dramatic writers were unwilling to represent an
act of rebellion on the stage, lest they should appear to
countenance what, in the eyes of every good Spaniard,
was one of the most heinous of all offences.<a name="FNanchor_1231_1231" id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> Whatever
the king came in contact with, was in some degree
hallowed by his touch. No one might mount a horse
which he had ridden;<a name="FNanchor_1232_1232" id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a> no one might marry a mistress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
whom he had deserted.<a name="FNanchor_1233_1233" id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> Horse and mistress alike
were sacred, and it would have been impious for any
subject to meddle with what had been honoured by the
Lord's anointed. Nor were such rules confined to the
prince actually reigning. On the contrary, they survived
him, and, working with a sort of posthumous
force, forbade any woman whom he had taken as a
wife, to marry, even after he was dead. She had been
chosen by the king; such choice had already raised her
above the rest of mortals; and the least she could do
was to retire to a convent, and spend her life mourning
over her irreparable loss. These regulations were
enforced by custom rather than by law.<a name="FNanchor_1234_1234" id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
upheld by the popular will, and were the result of the
excessive loyalty of the Spanish nation. Of that loyalty
their writers often boast, and with good reason, since
it was certainly matchless, and nothing seemed able to
shake it. To bad kings and to good kings it equally
applied. It was in full strength amid the glory of
Spain in the sixteenth century; it was conspicuous
when the nation was decaying in the seventeenth
century; and it survived the shock of civil wars early
in the eighteenth.<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a> Indeed, the feeling had so worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
itself into the traditions of the country, as to become
not only a national passion, but almost an article of
national faith. Clarendon, in his History of that great
English Rebellion, the like of which, as he well knew,
could never have happened in Spain, makes on this
subject a just and pertinent remark. He says that a
want of respect for kings is regarded by the Spaniards
as a &lsquo;monstrous crime;&rsquo; &lsquo;submissive reverence to their
princes being a vital part of their religion.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a></p>

<p>These, then, were the two great elements of which
the Spanish character was compounded. Loyalty and
superstition; reverence for their kings and reverence
for their clergy were the leading principles which
influenced the Spanish mind, and governed the march
of Spanish history. The peculiar and unexampled circumstances
under which they arose, have been just
indicated; and having seen their origin, we will now
endeavour to trace their consequences. Such an examination
of results will be the more important, not only
because nowhere else in Europe have these feelings
been so strong, so permanent, and so unmixed, but also
because Spain, being seated at the further extremity of
the Continent, from which it is cut off by the Pyrenees,
has, from physical causes, as well as from moral ones,
come little into contact with other nations.<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a> The course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
of affairs being, therefore, undisturbed by foreign
habits, it becomes easier to discover the pure and
natural consequences of superstition and loyalty, two
of the most powerful and disinterested feelings which
have ever occupied the human heart, and to whose
united action we may clearly trace the leading events
in the history of Spain.</p>

<p>The results of this combination were, during a considerable
period, apparently beneficial, and certainly
magnificent. For, the church and the crown making
common cause with each other, and being inspirited by
the cordial support of the people, threw their whole
soul into their enterprises, and displayed an ardour
which could hardly fail to insure success. Gradually
advancing from the north of Spain, the Christians,
fighting their way inch by inch, pressed on till they
reached the southern extremity, completely subdued
the Mohammedans, and brought the whole country
under one rule and one creed. This great result was
achieved late in the fifteenth century, and it cast an
extraordinary lustre on the Spanish name.<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a> Spain,
long occupied by her own religious wars, had hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
been little noticed by foreign powers, and had possessed
little leisure to notice them. Now, however, she
formed a compact and undivided monarchy, and at
once assumed an important position in European
affairs.<a name="FNanchor_1239_1239" id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a> During the next hundred years, her power
advanced with a speed of which the world had seen no
example since the days of the Roman Empire. So late
as 1478 Spain was still broken up into independent and
often hostile states; Granada was possessed by the
Mohammedans; the throne of Castile was occupied by
one prince, the throne of Aragon by another. Before
the year 1590, not only were these fragments firmly
consolidated into one kingdom, but acquisitions were
made abroad so rapidly as to endanger the independence
of Europe. The history of Spain, during
this period, is the history of one long and uninterrupted
success. That country, recently torn by civil
wars, and distracted by hostile creeds, was able in
three generations to annex to her territory the whole
of Portugal, Navarre, and Roussillon. By diplomacy,
or by force of arms, she acquired Artois and Franche
Comté, and the Netherlands; also the Milanese, Naples,
Sicily, Sardinia, the Balearic Islands, and the Canaries.
One of her kings was emperor of Germany; while his
son influenced the councils of England, whose queen
he married. The Turkish power, then one of the most
formidable in the world, was broken and beaten back
on every side. The French monarchy was humbled.
French armies were constantly worsted; Paris was
once in imminent jeopardy; and a king of France,
after being defeated on the field, was taken captive, and
led prisoner to Madrid. Out of Europe, the deeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
of Spain were equally wonderful. In America, the
Spaniards became possessed of territories which covered
sixty degrees of latitude, and included both the tropics.
Besides Mexico, Central America, Venezuela, New
Granada, Peru, and Chili, they conquered Cuba, San
Domingo, Jamaica, and other islands. In Africa, they
obtained Ceuta, Melilla, Oran, Bougiah, and Tunis, and
overawed the whole coast of Barbary. In Asia, they
had settlements on each side of the Deccan; they held
part of Malacca; and they established themselves in
the Spice Islands. Finally, by the conquest of the noble
archipelago of the Philippines, they connected their
most distant acquisitions, and secured a communication
between every part of that enormous empire which
girdled the world.</p>

<p>In connexion with this, a great military spirit arose,
such as no other modern nation has ever exhibited. All
the intellect of the country which was not employed in
the service of the Church was devoted to the profession
of arms. Indeed, the two pursuits were often united;
and it is said that the custom of ecclesiastics going to
war was practised in Spain long after it was abandoned
in other parts of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_1240_1240" id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a> At all events, the general
tendency is obvious. A mere list of successful battles
and sieges in the sixteenth and part of the fifteenth century,
would prove the vast superiority of the Spaniards,
in this respect, over their contemporaries, and would
show how much genius they had expended in maturing
the arts of destruction. Another illustration, if another
were required, might be drawn from the singular fact
that since the time of ancient Greece, no country has
produced so many eminent literary men who were also
soldiers. Calderon, Cervantes, and Lope de Vega
risked their lives in fighting for their country. The
military profession was also adopted by many other

Argote de Molina, Acuña, Bernal Diaz del Castillo,
Boscan, Carrillo, Cetina, Ercilla, Espinel, Francisco de
Figueroa, Garcilasso de la Vega, Guillen de Castro,

whom bore, in this manner, unconscious testimony to
the spirit by which Spain was universally pervaded.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have a combination which many
readers will still consider with favour, and which, at
the time it occurred, excited the admiration, albeit the
terror, of Europe. We have a great people glowing
with military, patriotic, and religious ardour, whose
fiery zeal was heightened, rather than softened, by a
respectful obedience to their clergy, and by a chivalrous
devotion to their kings. The energy of Spain, being
thus both animated and controlled, became wary as
well as eager; and to this rare union of conflicting
qualities we must ascribe the great deeds which have
just been related. But the unsound part of a progress
of this sort is, that it depends too much upon individuals,
and therefore cannot be permanent. Such a
movement can only last as long as it is headed by able
men. When, however, competent leaders are succeeded
by incompetent ones, the system immediately falls to
the ground, simply because the people have been accustomed
to supply to every undertaking the necessary
zeal, but have not been accustomed to supply the skill
by which the zeal is guided. A country in this state,
if governed by hereditary princes, is sure to decay;
inasmuch as, in the ordinary course of affairs, incapable
rulers must sometimes arise. Directly this happens,
the deterioration begins; for the people, habituated to
indiscriminate loyalty, will follow wherever they are
led, and will yield to foolish counsels the same obedience
that they had before paid to wise ones. This leads us
to perceive the essential difference between the civilization
of Spain and the civilization of England. We, in
England, are a critical, dissatisfied, and captious people,
constantly complaining of our rulers, suspecting their
schemes, discussing their measures in a hostile spirit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
allowing very little power either to the Church or to the
Crown, managing our own affairs in our own way, and
ready, on the slightest provocation, to renounce that
conventional, lip-deep loyalty, which, having never
really touched our hearts, is a habit lying on the surface,
but not a passion rooted in the mind. The loyalty of
Englishmen is not of that sort which would induce
them to sacrifice their liberties to please their prince,
nor does it ever, for a moment, blind them to a keen
sense of their own interests. The consequence is, that
our progress is uninterrupted, whether our kings are
good or whether they are bad. Under either condition,
the great movement goes on. Our sovereigns have had
their full share of imbecility and of crime. Still, even
men like Henry III. and Charles II. were unable to do
us harm. In the same way, during the eighteenth and
many years of the nineteenth century, when our improvement
was very conspicuous, our rulers were very
incompetent. Anne and the first two Georges were
grossly ignorant; they were wretchedly educated, and
nature had made them at once weak and obstinate.
Their united reigns lasted nearly sixty years; and after
they had passed away, we, for another period of sixty
years, were governed by a prince who was long incapacitated
by disease, but of whom we must honestly say
that, looking at his general policy, he was least mischievous
when he was most incapable. This is not the
place to expose the monstrous principles advocated by
George III., and to which posterity will do that justice
from which contemporary writers are apt to shrink;
but it is certain that neither his contracted understanding,
nor his despotic temper, nor his miserable
superstition, nor the incredible baseness of that ignoble
voluptuary who succeeded him on the throne, could do
aught to stop the march of English civilization, or to
stem the tide of English prosperity. We went on our
way rejoicing, caring for none of these things. We
were not to be turned aside from our path by the folly
of our rulers, because we know full well that we hold
our own fate in our own hands, and that the English
people possess within themselves those resources and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
that fertility of contrivance by which alone men can be
made great, and happy, and wise.</p>

<p>In Spain, however, directly the government slackened
its hold, the nation fell to pieces.<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a> During that prosperous
career which has just been noticed, the Spanish
throne was invariably filled by very able and intelligent
princes. Ferdinand and Isabella, Charles V. and Philip
II., formed a line of sovereigns not to be matched in any
other country for a period of equal length. By them,
the great things were effected, and by their care, Spain
apparently flourished. But, what followed when they
were withdrawn from the scene, showed how artificial
all this was, and how rotten, even to the core, is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
system of government which must be fostered before it
can thrive, and which, being based on the loyalty and
reverence of the people, depends for success not on the
ability of the nation, but on the skill of those to whom
the interests of the nation are entrusted.</p>

<p>Philip II., the last of the great kings of Spain, died
in 1598, and after his death the decline was portentously
rapid.<a name="FNanchor_1242_1242" id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a> From 1598 to 1700, the throne was
occupied by Philip III., Philip IV., and Charles II. The
contrast between them and their predecessors was most
striking.<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> Philip III. and Philip IV. were idle, ignorant,
infirm of purpose, and passed their lives in the
lowest and most sordid pleasures. Charles II., the last
of that Austrian dynasty which had formerly been so
distinguished, possessed nearly every defect which can
make a man ridiculous and contemptible. His mind
and his person were such as, in any nation less loyal
than Spain, would have exposed him to universal derision.
Although his death took place while he was
still in the prime of life, he looked like an old and worn-out
debauchee. At the age of thirty-five, he was
completely bald; he had lost his eyebrows; he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
paralyzed; he was epileptic; and he was notoriously
impotent.<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a> His general appearance was absolutely
revolting, and was that of a drivelling idiot. To an
enormous mouth, he added a nether jaw protruding so
hideously that his teeth could never meet, and he was
unable to masticate his food.<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> His ignorance would
be incredible, if it were not substantiated by unimpeachable
evidence. He did not know the names of
the large towns, or even of the provinces, in his dominions;
and during the war with France he was heard
to pity England for losing cities which in fact formed
part of his own territory.<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> Finally, he was immersed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
in the most grovelling superstition; he believed himself
to be constantly tempted by the devil; he allowed
himself to be exorcised as one possessed by evil spirits;
and he would not retire to rest, except with his confessor
and two friars, who had to lie by his side during
the night.<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a></p>

<p>Now it was that men might clearly see on how sandy
a foundation the grandeur of Spain was built. When
there were able sovereigns, the country prospered;
when there were weak ones, it declined. Nearly everything
that had been done by the great princes of the
sixteenth century, was undone by the little princes of
the seventeenth. So rapid was the fall of Spain, that
in only three reigns after the death of Philip II., the
most powerful monarchy existing in the world was depressed
to the lowest point of debasement, was insulted
with impunity by foreign nations, was reduced more
than once to bankruptcy, was stripped of her fairest
possessions, was held up to public opprobrium, was
made a theme on which school-boys and moralists loved
to declaim respecting the uncertainty of human affairs,
and, at length, was exposed to the bitter humiliation of
seeing her territories mapped out and divided by a treaty
in which she took no share, but the provisions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
which she was unable to resent.<a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> Then, truly, did she
drink to the dregs the cup of her own shame. Her
glory had departed from her, she was smitten down
and humbled. Well might a Spaniard of that time
who compared the present with the past, mourn over
his country, the chosen abode of chivalry and romance,
of valour and of loyalty. The mistress of the world,
the queen of the ocean, the terror of nations, was gone;
her power was gone, no more to return. To her might
be applied that bitter lamentation, which, on a much
slighter occasion, the greatest of the sons of men has
put into the mouth of a dying statesman. Good reason,
indeed, had the sorrowing patriot to weep, as one who
refused to be comforted, for the fate of his earth, his
realm, his land of dear souls, his dear, dear land, long
dear for her reputation through the world, but now
leased out like to a tenement or pelting farm.<a name="FNanchor_1249_1249" id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be a weary and unprofitable task to relate
the losses and disasters of Spain during the seventeenth
century. The immediate cause of them was
undoubtedly bad government and unskilful rulers; but
the real and overriding cause, which determined the
whole march and tone of affairs, was the existence of
that loyal and reverential spirit which made the people
submit to what any other country would have spurned,
and, by accustoming them to place extreme confidence
in individual men reduced the nation to that precarious
position in which a succession of incompetent
princes was sure to overthrow the edifice which competent
ones had built up.<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a></p>

<p>The increasing influence of the Spanish Church was
the first and most conspicuous consequence of the
declining energy of the Spanish government. For,
loyalty and superstition being the main ingredients of
the national character, and both of them being the
result of habits of reverence, it was to be expected that,
unless the reverence could be weakened, what was
taken from one ingredient would be given to the other.
As, therefore, the Spanish government, during the
seventeenth century, did, owing to its extreme imbecility,
undoubtedly lose some part of the hold it
possessed over the affections of the people, it naturally
happened that the Church stepped in, and occupying
the vacant place, received what the crown had forfeited.
Besides this, the weakness of the executive government
encouraged the pretensions of the priesthood, and
emboldened the clergy to acts of usurpation, which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
Spanish sovereigns of the sixteenth century, superstitious
though they were, would not have allowed for
a single moment.<a name="FNanchor_1251_1251" id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> Hence the very striking fact, that,
while in every other great country, Scotland alone
excepted, the power of the Church diminished during
the seventeenth century, it, in Spain, actually increased.
The results of this are well worth the attention, not
only of philosophic students of history, but also of
every one who cares for the welfare of his own country,
or feels an interest in the practical management of
public affairs.</p>

<p>For twenty-three years after the death of Philip II.,
the throne was occupied by Philip III., a prince as
distinguished by his weakness as his predecessors had
been by their ability. During more than a century
the Spaniards had been accustomed to be entirely ruled
by their kings, who, with indefatigable industry, personally
superintended the most important transactions,
and in other matters exercised the strictest supervision
over their ministers. But Philip III., whose listlessness
almost amounted to fatuity, was unequal to such
labour, and delegated the powers of government to
Lerma, who wielded supreme authority for twenty
years.<a name="FNanchor_1252_1252" id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a> Among a people so loyal as the Spaniards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
this unusual proceeding could not fail to weaken the
executive; since, in their eyes, the immediate and irresistible
interference of the sovereign was essential to
the management of affairs, and to the well-being of the
nation. Lerma, well aware of this feeling, and conscious
that his own position was very precarious,
naturally desired to strengthen himself by additional
support, so that he might not entirely depend on the
favour of the king. He therefore formed a strict
alliance with the clergy, and, from the beginning to the
end of his long administration did everything in his
power to increase their authority.<a name="FNanchor_1253_1253" id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a> Thus the influence
lost by the crown was gained by the Church, to whose
advice a deference was paid even greater than had
been accorded by the superstitious princes of the
sixteenth century. In this arrangement, the interests
of the people were of course unheeded. Their welfare
formed no part of the general scheme. On the contrary,
the clergy, grateful to a government so sensible
of their merits, and so religiously disposed, used all
their influence in its favour; and the yoke of a double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
despotism was riveted more firmly than ever upon the
neck of that miserable nation, which was now about to
reap the bitter fruit of a long and ignominious submission.<a name="FNanchor_1254_1254" id="FNanchor_1254_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a></p>

<p>The increasing power of the Spanish Church during
the seventeenth century, may be proved by nearly every
description of evidence. The convents and churches
multiplied with such alarming speed, and their wealth
became so prodigious, that even the Cortes, broken and
humbled though they were, ventured on a public remonstrance.
In 1626, only five years after the death
of Philip III., they requested that some means might
be taken to prevent what they described as a constant
invasion on the part of the Church. In this remarkable
document, the Cortes, assembled at Madrid, declared
that never a day passed in which laymen were not
deprived of their property to enrich ecclesiastics; and
the evil, they said, had grown to such a height, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
there were then in Spain upwards of nine thousand
monasteries, besides nunneries.<a name="FNanchor_1255_1255" id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a> This extraordinary
statement has, I believe, never been contradicted, and
its probability is enhanced by several other circumstances.
Davila, who lived in the reign of Philip III.,
affirms that in 1623, the two orders of Dominicans and
Franciscans alone amounted to thirty-two thousand.<a name="FNanchor_1256_1256" id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a>
The other clergy increased in proportion. Before the
death of Philip III., the number of ministers performing
in the Cathedral of Seville had swelled to one
hundred; and in the diocese of Seville, there were
fourteen thousand chaplains; in the diocese of Calahorra,
eighteen thousand.<a name="FNanchor_1257_1257" id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a> Nor did there seem any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
prospect of remedying this frightful condition. The
richer the Church became, the greater was the inducement
for laymen to enter it; so that there appeared to
be no limit to the extent to which the sacrifice of
temporal interests might be carried.<a name="FNanchor_1258_1258" id="FNanchor_1258_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a> Indeed, the
movement, notwithstanding its suddenness, was perfectly
regular, and was facilitated by a long train of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
preceding circumstances. Since the fifth century, the
course of events, as we have already seen, invariably
tended in this direction, and insured to the clergy a
dominion which no other nation would have tolerated.
The minds of the people being thus prepared, the
people themselves looked on in silence at what it would
have been impious to oppose; for, as a Spanish historian
observes, every proposition was deemed heretical which
tended to lessen the amount, or even to check the
growth of that enormous wealth which was now possessed
by the Spanish Church.<a name="FNanchor_1259_1259" id="FNanchor_1259_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a></p>

<p>How natural all this was, appears also from another
fact of considerable interest. In Europe generally, the
seventeenth century was distinguished by the rise of a
secular literature in which ecclesiastical theories were
disregarded; the most influential writers, such as Bacon
and Descartes, being laymen, rather hostile to the
Church than friendly to it, and composing their works
with views purely temporal. But in Spain, no change
of this sort occurred.<a name="FNanchor_1260_1260" id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a> In that country, the Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
retained her hold over the highest as well as over the
lowest intellects. Such was the pressure of public
opinion, that authors of every grade were proud to
count themselves members of the ecclesiastical profession,
the interests of which they advocated with a zeal
worthy of the Dark Ages. Cervantes, three years
before his death, became a Franciscan monk.<a name="FNanchor_1261_1261" id="FNanchor_1261_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> Lope
de Vega was a priest; he was an officer of the Inquisition;
and in 1623 he assisted at an auto da fé, in
which, amid an immense concourse of people, a heretic
was burned outside the gate of Alcalá at Madrid.<a name="FNanchor_1262_1262" id="FNanchor_1262_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a>
Moreto, one of the three greatest dramatists Spain has
produced, assumed the monastic habit during the last
twelve years of his life.<a name="FNanchor_1263_1263" id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a> Montalvan, whose plays are
still remembered, was a priest, and held office in the
Inquisition.<a name="FNanchor_1264_1264" id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a> Tarrega, Mira de Mescua, and Tirso de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>

were all clergymen.<a name="FNanchor_1265_1265" id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a> Solis, the celebrated historian

Philip III. appointed historiographer, and who is the

Martin Carrillo was a jurisconsult as well as an historian,
but, not satisfied with his double employment,
he too entered the Church, and became canon of Saragossa.<a name="FNanchor_1271_1271" id="FNanchor_1271_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a>
Antonio, the most learned bibliographer
Spain ever possessed, was a canon of Seville.<a name="FNanchor_1272_1272" id="FNanchor_1272_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a> Gracian,

Among the poets, the same tendency was exhibited.
Paravicino was for sixteen years a popular preacher at
the courts of Philip III. and Philip IV.<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a> Zamora was

Gongora was a priest;<a name="FNanchor_1277_1277" id="FNanchor_1277_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a> and Rioja received a high post<a name="FNanchor_1278_1278" id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
in the Inquisition. Calderon was chaplain to Philip
IV.;<a name="FNanchor_1279_1279" id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a> and so fanatical are the sentiments which tarnish
his brilliant genius, that he has been termed the
poet of the Inquisition.<a name="FNanchor_1280_1280" id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a> His love for the Church was
a passion, and he scrupled at nothing which could
advance its interests. In Spain, such feelings were
natural; though to other nations they seem so strange,
that an eminent critic has declared that it is hardly
possible to read his works without indignation.<a name="FNanchor_1281_1281" id="FNanchor_1281_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a> If
this be so, the indignation should be extended to nearly
all his contemporary countrymen, great or small. There
was hardly a Spaniard of that period who did not entertain
similar sentiments. Even Villaviciosa, author of
one of the very best mock-heroic poems Spain has produced,
was not only an officer in the Inquisition, but, in
his last will, he strongly urged upon his family and all
his descendants, that they too should, if possible, enter
the service of that noble institution, taking whatever
place in it they could obtain, since all its offices were,
he said, worthy of veneration.<a name="FNanchor_1282_1282" id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a> In such a state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
society, anything approaching to a secular or scientific
spirit was, of course, impossible. Every one believed;
no one inquired. Among the better classes, all were
engaged in war or theology, and most were occupied
with both. Those who made literature a profession,
ministered, as professional men too often do, to the
prevailing prejudice. Whatever concerned the Church
was treated not only with respect, but with timid veneration.
Skill and industry worthy of a far better cause,
were expended in eulogizing every folly which superstition
had invented. The more cruel and preposterous
a custom was, the greater the number of persons who
wrote in its favour, albeit no one had ventured to assail
it. The quantity of Spanish works to prove the necessity
of religious persecution is incalculable; and this
took place in a country where not one man in a thousand
doubted the propriety of burning heretics. As to
miracles, which form the other capital resource of
theologians, they, in the seventeenth century, were constantly
happening, and as constantly being recorded.
All literary men were anxious to say something on that
important subject. Saints, too, being in great repute,
their biographies were written in profusion, and with
an indifference to truth which usually characterizes
that species of composition. With these and kindred
topics, the mind of Spain was chiefly busied. Monasteries,
nunneries, religious orders, and cathedrals
received equal attention, and huge books were written
about them, in order that every particular might be
preserved. Indeed, it often happened that a single
convent, or a single cathedral, would have more than
one historian; each seeking to distance his immediate
competitor, and all striving which could do most to
honour the Church and to uphold the interests of which
the Church was the guardian.<a name="FNanchor_1283_1283" id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<p>Such, was the preponderance of the ecclesiastical
profession, and such was the homage paid to ecclesiastical
interests by the Spaniards during the seventeenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_1284_1284" id="FNanchor_1284_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a> They did everything to strengthen the
Church in that very age when other nations first set
themselves in earnest to weaken it. This unhappy
peculiarity was undoubtedly the effect of preceding
events; but it was the immediate cause of the decline
of Spain, since, whatever may have been the case in
former periods, it is certain that, in modern times, the
prosperity of nations depends on principles to which
the clergy, as a body, are invariably opposed. Under
Philip III. they gained an immense accession of
strength; and in that very reign they signalized this
new epoch of their power by obtaining, with circumstances
of horrible barbarity, the expulsion of the
whole Moorish nation. This was an act so atrocious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
in itself,<a name="FNanchor_1285_1285" id="FNanchor_1285_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a> and so terrible in its consequences, that
some writers have ascribed to it alone, the subsequent
ruin of Spain; forgetting that other causes, far more
potent, were also at work, and that this stupendous
crime could never have been perpetrated, except in a
country which, being long accustomed to regard heresy
as the most heinous of all offences, was ready, at any
cost, to purge the land and to free itself from men
whose mere presence was regarded as an insult to the
Christian faith.</p>

<p>After the reduction, late in the fifteenth century, of
the last Mohammedan kingdom in Spain, the great
object of the Spaniards became to convert those whom
they had conquered.<a name="FNanchor_1286_1286" id="FNanchor_1286_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> They believed that the future
welfare of a whole people was at stake; and finding
that the exhortations of their clergy had no effect, they
had recourse to other means, and persecuted the men
they were unable to persuade. By torturing some,
by burning others, and by threatening all, they at
length succeeded; and we are assured that, after the
year 1526, there was no Mohammedan in Spain, who
had not been converted to Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_1287_1287" id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a> Immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
numbers of them were baptized by force; but being
baptized, it was held that they belonged to the Church,
and were amenable to her discipline.<a name="FNanchor_1288_1288" id="FNanchor_1288_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a> That discipline
was administered by the Inquisition, which,
during the rest of the sixteenth century, subjected
these new Christians, or Moriscoes, as they were now
called,<a name="FNanchor_1289_1289" id="FNanchor_1289_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a> to the most barbarous treatment. The
genuineness of their forced conversion was doubted;
it therefore became the business of the Church to
inquire into their sincerity.<a name="FNanchor_1290_1290" id="FNanchor_1290_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a> The civil government
lent its aid; and among other enactments, an edict was
issued by Philip II. in 1566, ordering the Moriscoes to
abandon everything which by the slightest possibility
could remind them of their former religion. They
were commanded, under severe penalties, to learn
Spanish, and to give up all their Arabic books. They
were forbidden to read their native language, or to
write it, or even to speak it in their own houses.
Their ceremonies and their very games were strictly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
prohibited. They were to indulge in no amusements
which had been practised by their fathers; neither
were they to wear such clothes as they had been
accustomed to. Their women were to go unveiled; and
as bathing was a heathenish custom, all public baths
were to be destroyed, and even all baths in private
houses.<a name="FNanchor_1291_1291" id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a></p>

<p>By these and similar measures,<a name="FNanchor_1292_1292" id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a> these unhappy
people were at length goaded into rebellion; and in
1568 they took the desperate step of measuring their
force against that of the whole Spanish monarchy.
The result could hardly be doubted; but the Moriscoes
maddened by their sufferings, and fighting for their all,
protracted the contest till 1571, when the insurrection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
was finally put down.<a name="FNanchor_1293_1293" id="FNanchor_1293_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a> By this unsuccessful effort,
they were greatly reduced in numbers and in strength;
and, during the remaining twenty-seven years of the
reign of Philip II. we hear comparatively little of
them. Notwithstanding an occasional outbreak, the
old animosities were subsiding, and in the course of
time would probably have disappeared. At all events,
there was no pretence for violence on the part of the
Spaniards, since it was absurd to suppose that the
Moriscoes, weakened in every way, humbled, broken,
and scattered through the kingdom, could, even if
they desired it, effect any thing against the resources
of the executive government.</p>

<p>But, after the death of Philip II., that movement
began which I have just described, and which, contrary
to the course of affairs in other nations, secured
to the Spanish clergy in the seventeenth century, more
power than they had possessed in the sixteenth. The
consequences of this were immediately apparent.
The clergy did not think that the steps taken by
Philip II. against the Moriscoes were sufficiently decisive;
and even during his lifetime they looked forward
to a new reign, in which these Christians of doubtful
sincerity should be either destroyed or driven from
Spain.<a name="FNanchor_1294_1294" id="FNanchor_1294_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a> While he was on the throne, the prudence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
of the government restrained in some degree the eagerness
of the Church; and the king, following the
advice of his ablest ministers, refused to adopt the
measures to which he was urged, and to which his
own disposition prompted him.<a name="FNanchor_1295_1295" id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a> But, under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
successor, the clergy, as we have already seen, gained
fresh strength, and they soon felt themselves sufficiently
powerful to begin another and final crusade
against the miserable remains of the Moorish nation.<a name="FNanchor_1296_1296" id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a></p>

<p>The Archbishop of Valencia was the first to take
the field. In 1602, this eminent prelate presented a
memorial to Philip III. against the Moriscoes; and
finding that his views were cordially supported by the
clergy, and not discouraged by the crown, he followed
up the blow by another memorial having the same
object.<a name="FNanchor_1297_1297" id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a> The Archbishop, who spoke as one having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
authority, and who from his rank and position was a
natural representative of the Spanish Church, assured
the king that all the disasters which had befallen the
monarchy, had been caused by the presence of these
unbelievers, whom it was now necessary to root out,
even as David had done to the Philistines, and Saul to the
Amalekites.<a name="FNanchor_1298_1298" id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a> He declared that the Armada,
which Philip II. sent against England in 1588, had
been destroyed, because God would not allow even
that pious enterprise to succeed, while those who
undertook it, left heretics undisturbed at home. For
the same reason, the late expedition to Algiers had
failed; it being evidently the will of Heaven that
nothing should prosper while Spain was inhabited by
apostates.<a name="FNanchor_1299_1299" id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a> He, therefore, exhorted the king to exile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
all the Moriscoes, except some whom he might condemn
to work in the galleys, and others who could become
slaves, and labour in the mines of America.<a name="FNanchor_1300_1300" id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a> This,
he added, would make the reign of Philip glorious to
all posterity, and would raise his fame far above that
of his predecessors, who in this matter had neglected
their obvious duty.<a name="FNanchor_1301_1301" id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span></p>

<p>These remonstrances, besides being in accordance
with the known views of the Spanish Church, were
warmly supported by the personal influence of the
Archbishop of Toledo, the primate of Spain. In only
one respect did he differ from the views advocated by
the Archbishop of Valencia. The Archbishop of
Valencia thought that children under seven years of
age need not share in the general banishment, but
might, without danger to the faith, be separated from
their parents, and kept in Spain. To this, the Archbishop
of Toledo strongly objected. He was unwilling,
he said, to run the risk of pure Christian blood being
polluted by infidels; and he declared that sooner than
leave one of these unbelievers to corrupt the land, he
would have the whole of them, men, women, and
children, at once put to the sword.<a name="FNanchor_1302_1302" id="FNanchor_1302_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a></p>

<p>That they should all be slain, instead of being
banished, was the desire of a powerful party in the
Church, who thought that such signal punishment
would work good by striking terror into the heretics
of every nation. Bleda, the celebrated Dominican,
one of the most influential men of his time, wished
this to be done, and to be done thoroughly. He said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
that, for the sake of example, every Morisco in Spain
should have his throat cut, because it was impossible
to tell which of them were Christians at heart, and it
was enough to leave the matter to God, who knew his
own, and who would reward in the next world those
who were really Catholics.<a name="FNanchor_1303_1303" id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a></p>

<p>It was evident that the fate of the wretched remnant
of a once splendid nation was now sealed. The religious
scruples of Philip III. forbade him to struggle with
the Church; and his minister Lerma would not
risk his own authority by even the show of opposition.
In 1609, he announced to the king, that the expulsion
of the Moriscoes had become necessary. &lsquo;The resolution,&rsquo;
replied Philip, &lsquo;is a great one; let it be
executed.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_1304_1304" id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a> And executed it was, with unflinching
barbarity. About one million of the most industrious
inhabitants of Spain were hunted out like wild beasts,
because the sincerity of their religious opinions was
doubtful.<a name="FNanchor_1305_1305" id="FNanchor_1305_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a> Many were slain, as they approached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
coast; others were beaten and plundered; and the
majority, in the most wretched plight, sailed for Africa.
During the passage, the crew, in many of the ships, rose
upon them, butchered the men, ravished the women,
and threw the children into the sea. Those who escaped
this fate, landed on the coast of Barbary, where they
were attacked by the Bedouins, and many of them put
to the sword. Others made their way into the desert,
and perished from famine. Of the number of lives actually
sacrificed, we have no authentic account; but it
is said, on very good authority, that in one expedition,
in which 140,000 were carried to Africa, upwards of
100,000 suffered death in its most frightful forms
within a few months after their expulsion from Spain.<a name="FNanchor_1306_1306" id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, for the first time, the Church was really triumphant.<a name="FNanchor_1307_1307" id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a>
For the first time, there was not a heretic
to be seen between the Pyrenees and the Straits of
Gibraltar. All were orthodox, and all were loyal.
Every inhabitant of that great country obeyed the
Church, and feared the king. And from this happy
combination, it was believed that the prosperity and
grandeur of Spain were sure to follow. The name of
Philip III. was to be immortal, and posterity would
never weary of admiring that heroic act by which the
last remains of an infidel race were cast out from the
land. Those who had even remotely participated in
the glorious consummation, were to be rewarded by
the choicest blessings. Themselves, and their families,
were under the immediate protection of Heaven. The
earth should bear more fruit, and the trees should clap
their hands. Instead of the thorn should come up the
fir-tree, and instead of the brier, the myrtle. A new
era was now inaugurated, in which Spain, purged of her
heresy, was to be at ease, and men, living in safety,
were to sleep under the shade of their own vineyards,
sow their gardens in peace, and eat of the fruit of the
trees they had planted.<a name="FNanchor_1308_1308" id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span></p>

<p>These were the promises held out by the Church,
and believed by the people. It is our business to
inquire how far the expectations were fulfilled, and
what the consequences were of an act which was instigated
by the clergy, welcomed by the nation, and eagerly
applauded by some of the greatest men of genius
Spain has produced.<a name="FNanchor_1309_1309" id="FNanchor_1309_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>

<p>The effects upon the material prosperity of Spain
may be stated in a few words. From nearly every part
of the country, large bodies of industrious agriculturists
and expert artificers were suddenly withdrawn.
The best systems of husbandry then known, were
practised by the Moriscoes, who tilled and irrigated
with indefatigable labour.<a name="FNanchor_1310_1310" id="FNanchor_1310_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a> The cultivation of rice,
cotton, and sugar, and the manufacture of silk and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
paper, were almost confined to them.<a name="FNanchor_1311_1311" id="FNanchor_1311_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a> By their expulsion,
all this was destroyed at a blow, and most of
it was destroyed for ever. For, the Spanish Christians
considered such pursuits beneath their dignity. In
their judgment, war and religion were the only two
avocations worthy of being followed. To fight for the
king, or to enter the Church was honourable; but
everything else was mean and sordid.<a name="FNanchor_1312_1312" id="FNanchor_1312_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> When, therefore,
the Moriscoes were thrust out of Spain, there was
no one to fill their place; arts and manufactures either
degenerated, or were entirely lost, and immense regions
of arable land were left uncultivated. Some of the
richest parts of Valencia and Granada were so neglected,
that means were wanting to feed even the
scanty population which remained there.<a name="FNanchor_1313_1313" id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a> Whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
districts were suddenly deserted, and down to the
present day have never been repeopled. These solitudes
gave refuge to smugglers and brigands, who
succeeded the industrious inhabitants formerly occupying
them; and it is said, that from the expulsion of the
Moriscoes is to be dated the existence of those organized
bands of robbers, which, after this period, became the
scourge of Spain, and which no subsequent government
has been able entirely to extirpate.<a name="FNanchor_1314_1314" id="FNanchor_1314_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a></p>

<p>To these disastrous consequences, others were added,
of a different, and, if possible, of a still more serious
kind. The victory gained by the Church increased
both her power and her reputation. During the rest
of the seventeenth century, not only were the interests
of the clergy deemed superior to the interests of laymen,
but the interests of laymen were scarcely thought of.
The greatest men, with hardly an exception, became
ecclesiastics, and all temporal considerations, all views
of earthly policy, were despised and set at nought.
No one inquired; no one doubted; no one presumed
to ask if all this was right. The minds of men succumbed
and were prostrate. While every other
country was advancing, Spain alone was receding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
Every other country was making some addition to
knowledge, creating some art, or enlarging some
science. Spain, numbed into a death-like torpor, spellbound
and entranced by the accursed superstition
which preyed on her strength, presented to Europe a
solitary instance of constant decay. For her, no hope
remained; and, before the close of the seventeenth
century, the only question was, by whose hands the
blow should be struck, which would dismember that
once mighty empire, whose shadow had covered the
world, and whose vast remains were imposing even in
their ruin.</p>

<p>To indicate the different steps which mark the
decline of Spain would be hardly possible, since even
the Spaniards, who, when it was too late, were stung
with shame, have abstained from writing what would
only be the history of their own humiliation; so that
there is no detailed account of the wretched reigns of
Philip IV. and Charles II., which together comprise a
period of nearly eighty years.<a name="FNanchor_1315_1315" id="FNanchor_1315_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> Some facts, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
I have been able to collect, and they are very significant.
At the beginning of the seventeenth century,
the population of Madrid was estimated to be 400,000;
at the beginning of the eighteenth century, less than
200,000.<a name="FNanchor_1316_1316" id="FNanchor_1316_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a> Seville, one of the richest cities in Spain,
possessed in the sixteenth century upwards of sixteen
thousand looms, which gave employment to a hundred
and thirty thousand persons.<a name="FNanchor_1317_1317" id="FNanchor_1317_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a> By the reign of Philip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
V., these sixteen thousand looms had dwindled away
to less than three hundred;<a name="FNanchor_1318_1318" id="FNanchor_1318_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a> and, in a report which
the Cortes made to Philip IV., in 1662, it is stated that
the city contained only a quarter of its former number
of inhabitants, and that even the vines and olives cultivated
in its neighbourhood, and which comprised a
considerable part of its wealth, were almost entirely
neglected.<a name="FNanchor_1319_1319" id="FNanchor_1319_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a> Toledo, in the middle of the sixteenth
century, had upwards of fifty woollen manufactories;
in 1665, it had only thirteen, almost the whole of the
trade having been carried away by the Moriscoes, and
established at Tunis.<a name="FNanchor_1320_1320" id="FNanchor_1320_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a> Owing to the same cause, the
art of manufacturing silk, for which Toledo was celebrated,
was entirely lost, and nearly forty thousand
persons, who depended on it, were deprived of their
means of support.<a name="FNanchor_1321_1321" id="FNanchor_1321_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a> Other branches of industry
shared the same fate. In the sixteenth century, and
early in the seventeenth, Spain enjoyed great repute
for the manufacture of gloves, which were made in
enormous quantities, and shipped to many parts, being
particularly valued in England and France, and being
also exported to the Indies. But Martinez de Mata,
who wrote in the year 1655, assures us that at that
time this source of wealth had disappeared; the manufacture
of gloves having quite ceased, though formerly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
he says, it had existed in every city in Spain.<a name="FNanchor_1322_1322" id="FNanchor_1322_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a> In
the once-flourishing province of Castile, every thing
was going to ruin. Even Segovia lost its manufactures,
and retained nothing but the memory of its
former wealth.<a name="FNanchor_1323_1323" id="FNanchor_1323_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a> The decay of Burgos was equally
rapid; the trade of that famous city perished; and the
deserted streets and empty houses formed such a
picture of desolation, that a contemporary, struck by
the havoc, emphatically declared that Burgos had lost
every thing except its name.<a name="FNanchor_1324_1324" id="FNanchor_1324_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a> In other districts, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
results were equally fatal. The beautiful provinces of
the south, richly endowed by nature, had formerly
been so wealthy, that their contributions alone sufficed,
in time of need, to replenish the imperial treasury; but
they now deteriorated with such rapidity, that, by the
year 1640, it was found hardly possible to impose a tax
on them which would be productive.<a name="FNanchor_1325_1325" id="FNanchor_1325_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a> During the
latter half of the seventeenth century, matters became
still worse, and the poverty and wretchedness of the
people surpass all description. In the villages near
Madrid, the inhabitants were literally famishing; and
those farmers who had a stock of food refused to sell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
it, because, much as they needed money, they were apprehensive
of seeing their families perish around them.
The consequence was, that the capital was in danger
of being starved; and ordinary threats producing no
effect, it was found necessary, in 1664, that the President
of Castile, with an armed force, and accompanied
by the public executioner, should visit the adjacent
villages, and compel the inhabitants to bring their supplies
to the markets of Madrid.<a name="FNanchor_1326_1326" id="FNanchor_1326_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a> All over Spain, the
same destitution prevailed. That once rich and
prosperous country was covered with a rabble of
monks and clergy, whose insatiate rapacity absorbed
the little wealth yet to be found. Hence it happened,
that the government, though almost penniless, could
obtain no supplies. The tax-gatherers, urged to make
up the deficiency, adopted the most desperate expedients.
They not only seized the beds and all the
furniture, but they unroofed the houses, and sold the
materials of the roof, for whatever they would fetch.
The inhabitants were forced to fly; the fields were left
uncultivated; vast multitudes died from want and exposure;
entire villages were deserted; and in many of the
towns, upwards of two-thirds of the houses were, by
the end of the seventeenth century, utterly destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_1327_1327" id="FNanchor_1327_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of these calamities, the spirit and
energy of Spain were extinguished. In every department,
all power and life disappeared. The Spanish
troops were defeated at Rocroy in 1643; and several
writers ascribe to that battle the destruction of
the military reputation of Spain.<a name="FNanchor_1328_1328" id="FNanchor_1328_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_1328_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a> This, however,
was only one of many symptoms.<a name="FNanchor_1329_1329" id="FNanchor_1329_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1329_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a> In 1656, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
proposed to fit out a small fleet; but the fisheries on the
coast had so declined, that it was found impossible to
procure sailors enough to man even the few ships
which were required.<a name="FNanchor_1330_1330" id="FNanchor_1330_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1330_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a> The charts which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
made, were either lost or neglected; and the ignorance
of the Spanish pilots became so notorious, that no one
was willing to trust them.<a name="FNanchor_1331_1331" id="FNanchor_1331_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a> As to the military
service, it is stated, in an account of Spain, late in the
seventeenth century, that most of the troops had
deserted their colours, and that the few who were faithful
were clothed in rags, received no pay, and were
dying of hunger.<a name="FNanchor_1332_1332" id="FNanchor_1332_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1332_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a> Another account describes this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
once mighty kingdom as utterly unprotected; the
frontier towns ungarrisoned; the fortifications dilapidated
and crumbling away; the magazines without
ammunition; the arsenals empty; the workshops unemployed;
and even the art of building ships entirely
lost.<a name="FNanchor_1333_1333" id="FNanchor_1333_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1333_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a></p>

<p>While the country at large was thus languishing, as
if it had been stricken by some mortal distemper, the
most horrible scenes were occurring in the capital,
under the eyes of the sovereign. The inhabitants of
Madrid were starving; and the arbitrary measures
which had been adopted to supply them with food,
could only produce temporary relief. Many persons
fell down in the streets exhausted, and died where they
fell; others were seen in the public highway evidently
dying, but no one had wherewithal to feed them. At
length the people became desperate, and threw off all
control. In 1680, not only the workmen of Madrid, but
large numbers of the tradesmen, organized themselves
into bands, broke open private houses, and robbed and
murdered the inhabitants in the face of day.<a name="FNanchor_1334_1334" id="FNanchor_1334_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a> During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
the remaining twenty years of the seventeenth century,
the capital was in a state, not of insurrection, but of
anarchy. Society was loosened, and seemed to be
resolving itself into its elements. To use the emphatic
language of a contemporary, liberty and restraint were
equally unknown.<a name="FNanchor_1335_1335" id="FNanchor_1335_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a> The ordinary functions of the
executive government were suspended. The police of
Madrid, unable to obtain the arrears of their pay, disbanded,
and gave themselves up to rapine. Nor did
there seem any means of remedying these evils. The
exchequer was empty, and it was impossible to replenish
it. Such was the poverty of the court, that
money was wanting to pay the wages of the king's
private servants, and to meet the daily expenses of his
household.<a name="FNanchor_1336_1336" id="FNanchor_1336_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a> In 1693, payment was suspended of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
life-pension; and all officers and ministers of the crown
were mulcted of one-third of their salaries.<a name="FNanchor_1337_1337" id="FNanchor_1337_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a> Nothing,
however, could arrest the mischief. Famine and poverty
continued to increase;<a name="FNanchor_1338_1338" id="FNanchor_1338_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a> and, in 1699, Stanhope, the
British minister then residing in Madrid, writes, that
never a day passed in which people were not killed in
the streets scuffling for bread; that his own secretary
had seen five women stifled to death by the crowd
before a bakehouse; and that, to swell the catalogue of
misery, upwards of twenty thousand additional beggars
from the country had recently flocked into the capital.<a name="FNanchor_1339_1339" id="FNanchor_1339_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span></p>

<p>If this state of things had continued for another
generation, the wildest anarchy must have ensued, and
the whole frame of society been broken up.<a name="FNanchor_1340_1340" id="FNanchor_1340_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a> The
only chance of saving Spain from a relapse into barbarism,
was that it should fall, and fall quickly, under
foreign dominion. Such a change was indispensable;
and there was reason to fear that it might come in a
form which would have been inexpressibly odious to
the nation. For, late in the seventeenth century,
Ceuta was besieged by the Mohammedans; and as the
Spanish Government had neither troops nor ships, the
greatest apprehensions were entertained respecting the
fate of this important fortress; there being little doubt,
that if it fell, Spain would be again overrun by the
infidels, who, this time, at least, would have found
little difficulty in dealing with a people weakened by
suffering, half famished, and almost worn out.<a name="FNanchor_1341_1341" id="FNanchor_1341_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately, in the year 1700, when affairs were at
their worst, Charles II., the idiot king, died; and Spain
fell into the hands of Philip V., the grandson of Louis
XIV. This change from the Austrian dynasty to the
Bourbon,<a name="FNanchor_1342_1342" id="FNanchor_1342_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1342_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a> brought with it many other changes.
Philip, who reigned from 1700 to 1746,<a name="FNanchor_1343_1343" id="FNanchor_1343_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a> was a Frenchman,
not only by birth and education, but also in feelings
and habits.<a name="FNanchor_1344_1344" id="FNanchor_1344_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_1344_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a> Just before he entered Spain, Louis
charged him never to forget that he was a native of
France, the throne of which he might some day ascend.<a name="FNanchor_1345_1345" id="FNanchor_1345_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a>
After he became king, he neglected the
Spaniards, despised their advice, and threw all the
power he could command into the hands of his own
countrymen.<a name="FNanchor_1346_1346" id="FNanchor_1346_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a> The affairs of Spain were now administered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
by subjects of Louis XIV., whose ambassador
at Madrid frequently performed the functions of prime
minister.<a name="FNanchor_1347_1347" id="FNanchor_1347_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1347_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a> What had once been the most powerful
monarchy in the world, became little else than a province
of France; all important matters being decided
in Paris, from whence Philip himself received his instructions.<a name="FNanchor_1348_1348" id="FNanchor_1348_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a></p>

<p>The truth is, that Spain, broken and prostrate, was
unable to supply ability of any kind; and if the government
of the country was to be carried on, it was
absolutely necessary that foreigners should be called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
in.<a name="FNanchor_1349_1349" id="FNanchor_1349_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a> Even in 1682, that is, eighteen years before the
accession of Philip V., there was not to be found a single
native well acquainted with the art of war; so that
Charles II. was obliged to intrust the military defence
of the Spanish Netherlands to De Grana, the Austrian
ambassador at Madrid.<a name="FNanchor_1350_1350" id="FNanchor_1350_1350"></a><a href="#Footnote_1350_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a> When, therefore, the War
of the Succession broke out, in 1702, even the Spaniards
themselves desired that their troops should be commanded
by a foreigner.<a name="FNanchor_1351_1351" id="FNanchor_1351_1351"></a><a href="#Footnote_1351_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a> In 1704, the extraordinary
spectacle was exhibited of the Duke of Berwick, an
Englishman, leading Spanish soldiers against the
enemy, and being in fact generalissimo of the Spanish
army.<a name="FNanchor_1352_1352" id="FNanchor_1352_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a> The King of Spain, dissatisfied with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
proceedings, determined to remove him; but, instead of
filling his place with a native, he applied to Louis XIV.
for another general; and this important post was confided
to Marshal Tessé, a Frenchman.<a name="FNanchor_1353_1353" id="FNanchor_1353_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1353_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a> A little later,
Berwick was again summoned to Madrid, and ordered
to put himself at the head of the Spanish troops, and
defend Estremadura and Castile.<a name="FNanchor_1354_1354" id="FNanchor_1354_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a> This he effected
with complete success; and, in the battle of Almansa,
which he fought in 1707, he overthrew the invaders,
ruined the party of the pretender Charles,<a name="FNanchor_1355_1355" id="FNanchor_1355_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
secured the seat of Philip on the throne.<a name="FNanchor_1356_1356" id="FNanchor_1356_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a> As the war,
however, still continued, Philip, in 1710, wrote to
Paris for another general, and requested that the Duke
de Vendôme might be sent to him.<a name="FNanchor_1357_1357" id="FNanchor_1357_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a> This able commander,
on his arrival, infused new vigour into the
Spanish counsels, and utterly defeated the allies;<a name="FNanchor_1358_1358" id="FNanchor_1358_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a> so
that the war by which the independence of Spain was
established, owed its success to the ability of foreigners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
and to the fact that the campaigns were planned and
conducted, not by natives, but by French and English
generals.</p>

<p>In the same way, the finances were, by the end of
the seventeenth century, in such deplorable confusion,
that Portocarrero, who at the accession of Philip V.
was the nominal minister of Spain, expressed a desire
that they should be administered by some one sent
from Paris, who could restore them.<a name="FNanchor_1359_1359" id="FNanchor_1359_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a> He felt that no
one in Spain was equal to the task, and he was by no
means singular in this opinion. In 1701, Louville
wrote to Torcy, that if a financier did not soon arrive
from France, there would shortly be no finances to
administer.<a name="FNanchor_1360_1360" id="FNanchor_1360_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a> The choice fell upon Orry, who reached
Madrid in the summer of 1701.<a name="FNanchor_1361_1361" id="FNanchor_1361_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a> He found everything
in the most miserable condition; and the incompetence
of the Spaniards was so obvious, that he was
soon forced to undertake the management, not only of
the finances, but also of the war-department. To save
appearances, Canalez became the ostensible minister at
war; but he, being completely ignorant of affairs,
merely performed the drudgery of that office, the real
duties of which were fulfilled by Orry himself.<a name="FNanchor_1362_1362" id="FNanchor_1362_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span></p>

<p>This dominion of the French continued, without interruption,
until the second marriage of Philip V., in
1714, and the death of Louis XIV., in 1715, both of
which events weakened their influence, and for a time
almost destroyed it. The authority, however, which
they lost, was transferred, not to Spaniards, but to
other foreigners. Between 1714 and 1726, the two
most powerful and conspicuous men in Spain were
Alberoni, an Italian, and Ripperda, a Dutchman. Ripperda
was dismissed in 1726;<a name="FNanchor_1363_1363" id="FNanchor_1363_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a> and after his fall, the
affairs of Spain were controlled by Konigseg, who
was a German, and who, indeed, was the Austrian
ambassador residing at Madrid.<a name="FNanchor_1364_1364" id="FNanchor_1364_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a> Even Grimaldo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
who held office before and after the dismissal of Ripperda,
was a disciple of the French school, and had
been brought up under Orry.<a name="FNanchor_1365_1365" id="FNanchor_1365_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a> All this was not the
result of accident, nor is it to be ascribed to the caprice
of the court. In Spain, the national spirit had so died
away, that none but foreigners, or men imbued with
foreign ideas, were equal to the duties of government.
To the evidence already quoted on this point, I will
add two other testimonies. Noailles, a very fair judge,
and by no means prejudiced against the Spaniards, emphatically
stated, in 1710, that, notwithstanding their
loyalty, they were incapable of ruling, inasmuch as
they were ignorant both of war and of politics.<a name="FNanchor_1366_1366" id="FNanchor_1366_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a> In
1711, Bonnac mentions that a resolution had been
formed to place no Spaniard at the head of affairs, because
those hitherto employed had proved to be either
unfortunate or unfaithful.<a name="FNanchor_1367_1367" id="FNanchor_1367_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a></p>

<p>The government of Spain being taken from the
Spaniards, now began to show some signs of vigour.
The change was slight, but it was in the right direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
though, as we shall presently see, it could not
regenerate Spain, owing to the unfavourable operation
of general causes. Still, the intention was good. For
the first time, attempts were made to vindicate the
rights of laymen, and to diminish the authority of
ecclesiastics. Scarcely had the French established
their dominion, when they suggested that it might be
advisable to relieve the necessities of the state, by
compelling the clergy to give up some of the wealth
which they had accumulated in their churches.<a name="FNanchor_1368_1368" id="FNanchor_1368_1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_1368_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a>
Even Louis XIV. insisted that the important office of
President of Castile should not be conferred on an
ecclesiastic, because, he said, in Spain the priests and
monks had already too much power.<a name="FNanchor_1369_1369" id="FNanchor_1369_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1369_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a> Orry, who for
several years possessed immense influence, exerted it
in the same direction. He endeavoured to lessen the
immunities possessed by the clergy, in regard to taxation,
and also in regard to their exemption from lay
jurisdiction. He opposed the privilege of sanctuary;
he sought to deprive churches of their right of asylum.
He even attacked the Inquisition, and worked so
powerfully on the mind of the king, that Philip, at
one time, determined to suspend that dreadful tribunal,
and abolish the office of grand inquisitor.<a name="FNanchor_1370_1370" id="FNanchor_1370_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1370_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a> This intention
was very properly abandoned; for there can be
no doubt that if it had been enforced, it would have
caused a revolution, in which Philip would probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
have lost his crown.<a name="FNanchor_1371_1371" id="FNanchor_1371_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a> In such case, a reaction would
have set in, which would have left the Church stronger
than ever. Many things, however, were done for
Spain in spite of the Spaniards.<a name="FNanchor_1372_1372" id="FNanchor_1372_1372"></a><a href="#Footnote_1372_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a> In 1707, the clergy
were forced to contribute to the state a small part
of their enormous wealth; the tax being disguised
under the name of a loan.<a name="FNanchor_1373_1373" id="FNanchor_1373_1373"></a><a href="#Footnote_1373_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a> Ten years later, during
the administration of Alberoni, this disguise was thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
off; and not only did government exact what was now
called &lsquo;the ecclesiastical tax,&rsquo; but it imprisoned or
exiled those priests who, refusing to pay, stood up for
the privileges of their order.<a name="FNanchor_1374_1374" id="FNanchor_1374_1374"></a><a href="#Footnote_1374_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a> This was a bold step
to be taken in Spain, and it was one on which, at that
time, no Spaniard would have ventured. Alberoni,
however, as a foreigner, was unversed in the traditions
of the country, which, indeed, on another memorable
occasion, he set at defiance. The government of
Madrid, acting in complete unison with public opinion,
had always been unwilling to negotiate with infidels;
meaning by infidels every people whose religious
notions differed from their own. Sometimes, such
negotiations were unavoidable, but they were entered
into with fear and trembling, lest the pure Spanish faith
should be tainted by too close a contact with unbelievers.
Even in 1698, when it was evident that the
monarchy was at its last gasp, and that nothing could
save it from the hands of the spoiler, the prejudice was
so strong, that the Spaniards refused to receive aid
from the Dutch, because the Dutch were heretics. At
that time, Holland was in the most intimate relation
with England, whose interest it was to secure the
independence of Spain against the machinations of
France. Obvious, however, as this was, the Spanish
theologians, being consulted respecting the proposal,
declared that it was inadmissible, since it would enable
the Dutch to propagate their religious opinions; so that,
according to this view, it was better to be subjugated
by a Catholic enemy, than to be assisted by a Protestant
friend.<a name="FNanchor_1375_1375" id="FNanchor_1375_1375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1375_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span></p>

<p>Still, much as the Spaniards hated Protestants, they
hated Mohammedans yet more.<a name="FNanchor_1376_1376" id="FNanchor_1376_1376"></a><a href="#Footnote_1376_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a> They could never
forget how the followers of that creed had once conquered
nearly the whole of Spain, and had, during
several centuries, possessed the fairest portion of it.
The remembrance of this strengthened their religious
animosity, and caused them to be the chief supporters
of nearly every war which was waged against the
Mohammedans, both of Turkey and of Africa.<a name="FNanchor_1377_1377" id="FNanchor_1377_1377"></a><a href="#Footnote_1377_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a> But
Alberoni, being a foreigner, was unmoved by these
considerations, and, to the astonishment of all Spain,
he, on the mere ground of political expediency, set at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
naught the principles of the Church, and not only concluded
an alliance with the Mohammedans, but supplied
them with arms and with money.<a name="FNanchor_1378_1378" id="FNanchor_1378_1378"></a><a href="#Footnote_1378_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a> It is, indeed,
true, that, in these and similar measures, Alberoni
opposed himself to the national will, and that he lived
to repent of his boldness. It is, however, also true, that
his policy was part of a great secular and anti-theological
movement, which, during the eighteenth century,
was felt all over Europe. The effects of that movement
were seen in the government of Spain, but not
in the people. This was because the government for
many years was wielded by foreigners, or by natives
imbued with a foreign spirit. Hence we find that,
during the greater part of the eighteenth century, the
politicians of Spain formed a class more isolated, and,
if I may so say, more living on their own intellectual
resources, than the politicians of any other country
during the same period. That this indicated a state of
disease, and that no political improvement can produce
real good, unless it is desired by the people before
being conferred on them, will be admitted by whoever
has mastered the lessons which history contains. The
results actually produced in Spain, we shall presently
see. But it will first be advisable that I should give
some further evidence of the extent to which the influence
of the Church had prostrated the national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
intellect, and by discouraging all inquiry, and fettering
all freedom of thought, had at length reduced the
country to such a plight, that the faculties of men,
rusted by disuse, were no longer equal to fulfil the
functions required from them; so that in every department,
whether of political life, or of speculative
philosophy, or even of mechanical industry, it was
necessary that foreigners should be called in, to do
that work, which the natives had become unable to
perform.</p>

<p>The ignorance in which the force of adverse circumstances
had sunk the Spaniards, and their inactivity,
both bodily and mental, would be utterly incredible, if
it were not attested by every variety of evidence.
Gramont, writing from personal knowledge of the
state of Spain, during the latter half of the seventeenth
century, describes the upper classes as not only unacquainted
with science or literature, but as knowing
scarcely any thing even of the commonest events
which occurred out of their own country. The lower
ranks, he adds, are equally idle, and rely upon foreigners
to reap their wheat, to cut their hay, and to build their
houses.<a name="FNanchor_1379_1379" id="FNanchor_1379_1379"></a><a href="#Footnote_1379_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a> Another observer of society, as it existed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
in Madrid in 1679, assures us that men, even of the highest
position, never thought it necessary that their
sons should study; and that those who were destined
for the army could not learn mathematics, if they desired
to do so, inasmuch as there were neither schools
nor masters to teach them.<a name="FNanchor_1380_1380" id="FNanchor_1380_1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1380_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a> Books, unless they
were books of devotion, were deemed utterly useless;
no one consulted them; no one collected them; and,
until the eighteenth century, Madrid did not possess a
single public library.<a name="FNanchor_1381_1381" id="FNanchor_1381_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a> In other cities professedly devoted
to purposes of education, similar ignorance prevailed.
Salamanca was the seat of the most ancient
and most famous university in Spain, and there, if anywhere,
we might look for the encouragement of
science.<a name="FNanchor_1382_1382" id="FNanchor_1382_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1382_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a> But De Torres, who was himself a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
Spaniard, and was educated at Salamanca, early in
the eighteenth century, declares that he had studied
at that university for five years before he had heard
that such things as the mathematical sciences
existed.<a name="FNanchor_1383_1383" id="FNanchor_1383_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1383_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a> So late as the year 1771, the same university
publicly refused to allow the discoveries of
Newton to be taught; and assigned as a reason, that
the system of Newton was not so consonant with revealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
religion as the system of Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_1384_1384" id="FNanchor_1384_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_1384_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a> All over
Spain, a similar plan was adopted. Everywhere,
knowledge was spurned, and inquiry discouraged.
Feijoo, who, notwithstanding his superstition, and a
certain slavishness of mind, from which no Spaniard of
that age could escape, did, on matters of science, seek
to enlighten his countrymen, has left upon record his
deliberate opinion, that whoever had acquired all that
was taught in his time under the name of philosophy,
would, as the reward of his labour, be more ignorant
than he was before he began.<a name="FNanchor_1385_1385" id="FNanchor_1385_1385"></a><a href="#Footnote_1385_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a> And there can be
no doubt that he was right. There can be no doubt
that, in Spain, the more a man was taught, the less he
would know. For, he was taught that inquiry was sinful,
that intellect must be repressed, and that credulity
and submission were the first of human attributes. The
Duke de Saint Simon, who, in 1721 and 1722, was the
French ambassador at Madrid, sums up his observations
by the remark, that, in Spain, science is a crime,
and ignorance a virtue.<a name="FNanchor_1386_1386" id="FNanchor_1386_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a> Fifty years later, another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
shrewd observer, struck with amazement at the condition
of the national mind, expresses his opinion in a
sentence equally pithy and almost equally severe.
Searching for an illustration to convey his sense of the
general darkness, he emphatically says, that the common
education of an English gentleman would, in
Spain, constitute a man of learning.<a name="FNanchor_1387_1387" id="FNanchor_1387_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a></p>

<p>Those who know what the common education of an
English gentleman was eighty years ago, will appreciate
the force of this comparison, and will understand how
benighted a country must have been, to which such a
taunt was applicable. To expect that, under such a
state of things, the Spaniards should make any of the
discoveries which accelerate the march of nations,
would be idle indeed; for they would not even receive
the discoveries, which other nations had made for them,
and had cast into the common lap. So loyal and
orthodox a people had nothing to do with novelties,
which, being innovations on ancient opinions, were
fraught with danger. The Spaniards desired to walk
in the ways of their ancestors, and not have their faith
in the past rudely disturbed. In the inorganic world,
the magnificent discoveries of Newton were contumeliously
rejected; and, in the organic world, the circulation
of the blood was denied, more than a hundred and
fifty years after Harvey had proved it.<a name="FNanchor_1388_1388" id="FNanchor_1388_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a> These things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
were new, and it was better to pause a little, and not
receive them too hastily. On the same principle, when,
in the year 1760, some bold men in the government
proposed that the streets of Madrid should be cleansed,
so daring a suggestion excited general anger. Not
only the vulgar, but even those who were called educated,
were loud in their censure. The medical profession,
as the guardians of the public health, were
desired, by the government, to give their opinion.
This, they had no difficulty in doing. They had no
doubt that the dirt ought to remain. To remove it, was
a new experiment; and of new experiments, it was impossible
to foresee the issue. Their fathers having lived
in the midst of it, why should not they do the same?
Their fathers were wise men, and must have had good
reasons for their conduct. Even the smell, of which
some persons complained, was most likely wholesome.
For, the air being sharp and piercing, it was extremely
probable that bad smells made the atmosphere heavy,
and in that way deprived it of some of its injurious
properties. The physicians of Madrid were, therefore,
of opinion that matters had better remain as their ancestors
had left them, and that no attempts should be
made to purify the capital by removing the filth which
lay scattered on every side.<a name="FNanchor_1389_1389" id="FNanchor_1389_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span></p>

<p>While such notions prevailed respecting the preservation
of health,<a name="FNanchor_1390_1390" id="FNanchor_1390_1390"></a><a href="#Footnote_1390_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a> it is hardly to be supposed that the
treatment of disease should be very successful. To
bleed and to purge, were the only remedies prescribed
by the Spanish physicians.<a name="FNanchor_1391_1391" id="FNanchor_1391_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a> Their ignorance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
commonest functions of the human body was altogether
surprising, and can only be explained on the supposition,
that in medicine, as in other departments, the
Spaniards of the eighteenth century knew no more than
their progenitors of the sixteenth. Indeed, in some respects,
they appeared to know less. For, their treatment
was so violent, that it was almost certain death to submit
to it for any length of time.<a name="FNanchor_1392_1392" id="FNanchor_1392_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a> Their own king,
Philip V., did not dare to trust himself in their hands,
but preferred having an Irishman for his physician.<a name="FNanchor_1393_1393" id="FNanchor_1393_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a>
Though the Irish had no great medical reputation, anything
was better than a Spanish doctor.<a name="FNanchor_1394_1394" id="FNanchor_1394_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a> The arts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
incidental to medicine and surgery, were equally backward.
The instruments were rudely made, and the
drugs badly prepared. Pharmacy being unknown, the
apothecaries' shops, in the largest towns, were entirely
supplied from abroad; while, in the smaller towns, and
in districts remote from the capital, the medicines were
of such a quality, that the best which could be hoped of
them was, that they might be innocuous. For, in the
middle of the eighteenth century, Spain did not possess
one practical chemist. Indeed, we are assured by
Campomanes himself, that, so late as the year 1776,
there was not to be found in the whole country a single
man who knew how to make the commonest drugs,
such as magnesia, Glauber's salts, and the ordinary
preparations of mercury and antimony. This eminent
statesman adds, however, that a chemical laboratory
was about to be established in Madrid; and although
the enterprise, being without a precedent, would surely
be regarded as a portentous novelty, he expresses a
confident expectation, that, by its aid, the universal
ignorance of his countrymen would in time be remedied.<a name="FNanchor_1395_1395" id="FNanchor_1395_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1395_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a></p>

<p>Whatever was useful in practice, or whatever subserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
the purposes of knowledge, had to come from
abroad. Ensenada, the well-known minister of Ferdinand
VI., was appalled by the darkness and apathy of
the nation, which he tried, but tried in vain, to remove.
When he was at the head of affairs, in the middle of
the eighteenth century, he publicly declared that in
Spain there was no professorship of public law, or of
physics, or of anatomy, or of botany. He further added,
that there were no good maps of Spain, and that there
was no person who knew how to construct them. All
the maps which they had, came from France and Holland.
They were, he said, very inaccurate; but the
Spaniards, being unable to make any, had nothing else
to rely on. Such a state of things he pronounced to be
shameful. For, as he bitterly complained, if it were
not for the exertions of Frenchmen and Dutchmen, it
would be impossible for any Spaniard to know either
the position of his own town, or the distance from one
place to another.<a name="FNanchor_1396_1396" id="FNanchor_1396_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span></p>

<p>The only remedy for all this, seemed to be foreign
aid; and Spain being now ruled by a foreign dynasty,
that aid was called in. Cervi established the Medical
Societies of Madrid and of Seville; Virgili founded the
College of Surgery at Cadiz; and Bowles endeavoured
to promote among the Spaniards the study of mineralogy.<a name="FNanchor_1397_1397" id="FNanchor_1397_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a>
Professors were sought for, far and wide;
and application was made to Linnæus to send a person
from Sweden who could impart some idea of botany to
physiological students.<a name="FNanchor_1398_1398" id="FNanchor_1398_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a> Many other and similar steps
were taken by the government, whose indefatigable
exertions would deserve our warmest praise, if we did
not know how impossible it is for any government to
enlighten a nation, and how absolutely essential it is
that the desire for improvement should, in the first
place, proceed from the people themselves. No progress
is real, unless it is spontaneous. The movement,
to be effective, must emanate from within, and not
from without; it must be due to general causes acting
on the whole country, and not to the mere will of a few
powerful individuals. During the eighteenth century,
all the means of improvement were lavishly supplied to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
the Spaniards; but the Spaniards did not want to improve.
They were satisfied with themselves; they were
sure of the accuracy of their own opinions; they were
proud of the notions which they inherited, and which
they did not wish either to increase or to diminish.
Being unable to doubt, they were, therefore, unwilling
to inquire. New and beautiful truths, conveyed in the
clearest and most attractive language, could produce
no effect upon men whose minds were thus hardened
and enslaved.<a name="FNanchor_1399_1399" id="FNanchor_1399_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a> An unhappy combination of events,
working without interruption since the fifth century,
had predetermined the national character in a particular
direction, and neither statesmen, nor kings, nor legislators,
could effect aught against it. The seventeenth
century was, however, the climax of all. In that age,
the Spanish nation fell into a sleep, from which, as a
nation, it has never since awakened. It was a sleep,
not of repose, but of death. It was a sleep, in which
the faculties, instead of being rested, were paralyzed,
and in which a cold and universal torpor succeeded that
glorious, though partial, activity, which, while it made
the name of Spain terrible in the world, had insured
the respect even of her bitterest enemies.</p>

<p>Even the fine arts, in which the Spaniards had
formerly excelled, partook of the general degeneracy,
and, according to the confession of their own writers,
had, by the beginning of the eighteenth century, fallen
into complete decay.<a name="FNanchor_1400_1400" id="FNanchor_1400_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a> The arts which secure national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
safety, were in the same predicament as those which
minister to national pleasure. There was no one in
Spain who could build a ship; there was no one who
knew how to rig it, after it was built. The consequence
was, that, by the close of the seventeenth century, the
few ships which Spain possessed, were so rotten, that,
says an historian, they could hardly support the fire of
their own guns.<a name="FNanchor_1401_1401" id="FNanchor_1401_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1401_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a> In 1752, the government, being
determined to restore the navy, found it necessary to
send to England for shipwrights; and they were also
obliged to apply to the same quarter for persons who
could make ropes and canvass; the skill of the natives
being unequal to such arduous achievements.<a name="FNanchor_1402_1402" id="FNanchor_1402_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a> In
this way, the ministers of the Crown, whose ability and
vigour, considering the difficult circumstances in which
the incapacity of the people placed them, were extremely
remarkable, contrived to raise a fleet superior
to any which had been seen in Spain for more than a
century.<a name="FNanchor_1403_1403" id="FNanchor_1403_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_1403_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a> They also took many other steps towards
putting the national defences into a satisfactory condition;
though in every instance, they were forced to
rely on the aid of foreigners. Both the military and
the naval service were in utter confusion, and had to
be organized afresh. The discipline of the infantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
was remodelled by O'Reilly, an Irishman, to whose
superintendence the military schools of Spain were intrusted.<a name="FNanchor_1404_1404" id="FNanchor_1404_1404"></a><a href="#Footnote_1404_1404" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a>
At Cadiz, a great naval academy was
formed, but the head of it was Colonel Godin, a French
officer.<a name="FNanchor_1405_1405" id="FNanchor_1405_1405"></a><a href="#Footnote_1405_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a> The artillery, which like everything else,
had become almost useless, was improved by Maritz,
the Frenchman; while the same service was rendered
to the arsenals by Gazola, the Italian.<a name="FNanchor_1406_1406" id="FNanchor_1406_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1406_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a></p>

<p>The mines, which form one of the greatest natural
sources of the wealth of Spain, had likewise suffered
from that ignorance and apathy into which the force
of circumstances had plunged the country. They
were either completely neglected, or if worked, they
were worked by other nations. The celebrated cobalt-mine,
situated in the valley of Gistan, in Aragon, was
entirely in the hands of the Germans, who, during the
first half of the eighteenth century, derived immense
profit from it.<a name="FNanchor_1407_1407" id="FNanchor_1407_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1407_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a> In the same way, the silver-mines of
Guadalcanal, the richest in Spain, were undertaken,
not by natives, but by foreigners. Though they had
been discovered in the sixteenth century, they, as well
as other matters of importance, had been forgotten in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
the seventeenth, and were reopened, in 1728, by
English adventurers; the enterprise, the tools, the
capital, and even the miners, all coming from England.<a name="FNanchor_1408_1408" id="FNanchor_1408_1408"></a><a href="#Footnote_1408_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a>
Another, and still more famous, mine is that
of Almaden in La Mancha, which produces mercury of
the finest quality, and in great profusion. This metal,
besides being indispensable for many of the commonest
arts, was of peculiar value to Spain, because without
it the gold and silver of the New World could not be
extracted from their ores. From Almaden, where
every natural facility exists for collecting it, and where
the cinnibar in which it is found is unusually rich, vast
supplies had formerly been drawn; but they had for
some time been diminishing, although the demand,
especially from foreign countries, was on the increase.
Under these circumstances, the Spanish government,
fearing that so important a source of wealth might
altogether perish, determined to institute an inquiry
into the manner in which the mine was worked. As,
however, no Spaniard possessed the knowledge requisite
for such an investigation, the advisers of the
Crown were obliged to call on foreigners to help them.
In 1752, an Irish naturalist, named Bowles, was commissioned
to visit Almaden, and ascertain the cause of
the failure. He found that the miners had acquired a
habit of sinking their shafts perpendicularly, instead
of following the direction of the vein.<a name="FNanchor_1409_1409" id="FNanchor_1409_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1409_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a> So absurd a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
process was quite sufficient to account for their want of
success; and Bowles reported to the government, that
if a shaft were to be sunk obliquely, the mine would,
no doubt, again be productive. The government approved
of the suggestion, and ordered it to be carried
into effect. But the Spanish miners were too tenacious
of their old customs to give way. They sank
their shafts in the same manner as their fathers had
done; and what their fathers had done must be right.
The result was, that the mine had to be taken out
of their hands; but as Spain could supply no other
labourers, it was necessary to send to Germany for
fresh ones.<a name="FNanchor_1410_1410" id="FNanchor_1410_1410"></a><a href="#Footnote_1410_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a> After their arrival, matters rapidly improved.
The mine, being superintended by an Irishman,
and worked by Germans, assumed quite a different
appearance; and, notwithstanding the disadvantages
with which new comers always have to contend, the
immediate consequence of the change was, that the
yield of mercury was doubled, and its cost to the consumer
correspondingly lowered.<a name="FNanchor_1411_1411" id="FNanchor_1411_1411"></a><a href="#Footnote_1411_1411" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a></p>

<p>Such ignorance, pervading the whole nation, and
extending to every department of life, is hardly conceivable,
considering the immense advantages which
the Spaniards had formerly enjoyed. It is particularly
striking, when contrasted with the ability of the
government, which, for more than eighty years, constantly
laboured to improve the condition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
country. Early in the eighteenth century, Ripperda,
in the hopes of stimulating Spanish industry, established
a large woollen manufactory at Segovia, which
had once been a busy and prosperous city. But the
commonest processes had now been forgotten; and he
was obliged to import manufacturers from Holland, to
teach the Spaniards how to make up the wool, though
that was an art for which in better days they had been
especially famous.<a name="FNanchor_1412_1412" id="FNanchor_1412_1412"></a><a href="#Footnote_1412_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a> In 1757, Wall, who was then
minister, constructed, upon a still larger scale, a
similar manufactory at Guadalajara in New Castile.
Soon, however, something went wrong with the machinery;
and as the Spaniards neither knew nor cared
anything about these matters, it was necessary to
send to England for a workman to put it right.<a name="FNanchor_1413_1413" id="FNanchor_1413_1413"></a><a href="#Footnote_1413_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a>
At length the advisers of Charles III., despairing of
rousing the people by ordinary means, devised a more
comprehensive scheme, and invited thousands of
foreign artisans to settle in Spain; trusting that their
example, and the suddenness of their influx might
invigorate this jaded nation.<a name="FNanchor_1414_1414" id="FNanchor_1414_1414"></a><a href="#Footnote_1414_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a> All was in vain.
The spirit of the country was broken, and nothing
could retrieve it. Among other attempts which were
made, the formation of a National Bank was a
favourite idea of politicians, who expected great things
from an institution which was to extend credit, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
make advances to persons engaged in business. But,
though the design was executed, it entirely failed in
effecting its purpose. When the people are not enterprising,
no effort of government can make them so.
In a country like Spain, a great bank was an exotic,
which might live with art, but could never thrive by
nature. Indeed, both in its origin and in its completion,
it was altogether foreign, having been first
proposed by the Dutchman Ripperda,<a name="FNanchor_1415_1415" id="FNanchor_1415_1415"></a><a href="#Footnote_1415_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a> and owing its
final organization to the Frenchman Cabarrus.<a name="FNanchor_1416_1416" id="FNanchor_1416_1416"></a><a href="#Footnote_1416_1416" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a></p>

<p>In everything, the same law prevailed. In diplomacy,
the ablest men were not Spaniards, but foreigners;
and during the eighteenth century the strange
spectacle was frequently exhibited, of Spain being
represented by French, Italian, and even Irish ambassadors.<a name="FNanchor_1417_1417" id="FNanchor_1417_1417"></a><a href="#Footnote_1417_1417" class="fnanchor">[1417]</a>
Nothing was indigenous; nothing was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
done by Spain herself. Philip V., who reigned from
1700 to 1746, and possessed immense power, always
clung to the ideas of his own country, and was a
Frenchman to the last. For thirty years after his
death, the three most prominent names in Spanish
politics were, Wall, who was born in France, of Irish
parents;<a name="FNanchor_1418_1418" id="FNanchor_1418_1418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1418_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a> Grimaldi, who was a native of Genoa; <a name="FNanchor_1419_1419" id="FNanchor_1419_1419"></a><a href="#Footnote_1419_1419" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a>
and Esquilache, who was a native of Sicily.<a name="FNanchor_1420_1420" id="FNanchor_1420_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1420_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a>
Esquilache administered the finances for several years;
and, after enjoying the confidence of Charles III. to an
extent rarely possessed by any minister, was only
dismissed, in 1766, in consequence of the discontents
of the people at the innovations introduced by this
bold foreigner.<a name="FNanchor_1421_1421" id="FNanchor_1421_1421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1421_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a> Wall, a much more remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
man, was, in the absence of any good Spanish diplomatist,
sent envoy to London in 1747; and after
exercising great influence in matters of state, he was
placed at the head of affairs in 1754, and remained
supreme till 1763.<a name="FNanchor_1422_1422" id="FNanchor_1422_1422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1422_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a> When this eminent Irishman relinquished
office, he was succeeded by the Genoese,
Grimaldi, who ruled Spain from 1763 to 1777, and
was entirely devoted to the French views of policy.<a name="FNanchor_1423_1423" id="FNanchor_1423_1423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1423_1423" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a>
His principal patron was Choiseul, who had imbued
him with his own notions, and by whose advice he was
chiefly guided.<a name="FNanchor_1424_1424" id="FNanchor_1424_1424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1424_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a> Indeed, Choiseul, who was then the
first minister in France, used to boast, with exaggeration,
but not without a considerable amount of truth,
that his influence in Madrid was even greater than it
was in Versailles.<a name="FNanchor_1425_1425" id="FNanchor_1425_1425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1425_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a></p>

<p>However this may be, it is certain that four years
after Grimaldi took office, the ascendency of France
was exhibited in a remarkable way. Choiseul, who
hated the Jesuits, and had just expelled them from
France, endeavoured also to expel them from Spain.<a name="FNanchor_1426_1426" id="FNanchor_1426_1426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1426_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
The execution of the plan was confided to Aranda,
who, though a Spaniard by birth, derived his intellectual
culture from France, and had contracted, in the
society of Paris, an intense hatred of every form of
ecclesiastical power.<a name="FNanchor_1427_1427" id="FNanchor_1427_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1427_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a> The scheme, secretly prepared,
was skilfully accomplished.<a name="FNanchor_1428_1428" id="FNanchor_1428_1428"></a><a href="#Footnote_1428_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a> In 1767, the
Spanish government, without hearing what the Jesuits
had to say in their defence, and indeed, without giving
them the least notice, suddenly ordered their expulsion;
and with such animosity were they driven from
the country, in which they sprung up, and had long been
cherished, that not only was their wealth confiscated,
and they themselves reduced to a wretched pittance,
but even that was directed to be taken from them, if
they published anything in their own vindication;
while it was also declared that whoever ventured to
write respecting them, should, if we were a subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
of Spain, be put to death, as one guilty of high
treason.<a name="FNanchor_1429_1429" id="FNanchor_1429_1429"></a><a href="#Footnote_1429_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a></p>

<p>Such boldness on the part of the government<a name="FNanchor_1430_1430" id="FNanchor_1430_1430"></a><a href="#Footnote_1430_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a>
caused even the Inquisition to tremble. That once
omnipotent tribunal, threatened and suspected by the
civil authorities, became more wary in its proceedings,
and more tender in its treatment of heretics. Instead
of extirpating unbelievers by hundreds or by thousands,
it was reduced to such pitiful straits, that between 1746
and 1759, it was only able to burn ten persons; and
between 1759 and 1788, only four persons.<a name="FNanchor_1431_1431" id="FNanchor_1431_1431"></a><a href="#Footnote_1431_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a> The
extraordinary diminution during the latter period, was
partly owing to the great authority wielded by Aranda,
the friend of the encyclopædists and of other French
sceptics. This remarkable man was President of
Castile till 1773,<a name="FNanchor_1432_1432" id="FNanchor_1432_1432"></a><a href="#Footnote_1432_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a> and he issued an order forbidding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
the Inquisition to interfere with the civil courts.<a name="FNanchor_1433_1433" id="FNanchor_1433_1433"></a><a href="#Footnote_1433_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a> He
also formed a scheme for entirely abolishing it; but
his plan was frustrated, owing to its premature
announcement by his friends in Paris, to whom it had
been confided.<a name="FNanchor_1434_1434" id="FNanchor_1434_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a> His views, however, were so far successful,
that after 1781, there is no instance in Spain
of a heretic being burned; the Inquisition being too
terrified by the proceedings of government to do anything
which might compromise the safety of the Holy
Institution.<a name="FNanchor_1435_1435" id="FNanchor_1435_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1435_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a></p>

<p>In 1777, Grimaldi, one of the chief supporters of
that anti-theological policy which France introduced
into Spain, ceased to be Minister; but he was succeeded
by Florida Blanca, who was his creature, and to whom
he transmitted his policy as well as his power.<a name="FNanchor_1436_1436" id="FNanchor_1436_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
progress, therefore, of political affairs continued in the
same direction. Under the new minister, as under his
immediate predecessors, a determination was shown to
abridge the authority of the Church, and to vindicate
the rights of laymen. In everything, the ecclesiastical
interests were treated as subordinate to the secular. Of
this, many instances might be given; but one is too
important to be omitted. We have seen, that early in
the eighteenth century, Alberoni, when at the head of
affairs, was guilty of what in Spain was deemed the
enormous offence of contracting an alliance with
Mohammedans; and there can be no doubt that this
was one of the chief causes of his fall, since it was held,
that no prospect of mere temporal advantages could
justify an union, or even a peace, between a Christian
nation and a nation of unbelievers.<a name="FNanchor_1437_1437" id="FNanchor_1437_1437"></a><a href="#Footnote_1437_1437" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a> But the Spanish
government, which, owing to the causes I have related,
was far in advance of Spain itself, was gradually
becoming bolder, and growing more and more disposed
to force upon the country, views, which, abstractedly
considered, where extremely enlightened, but which the
popular mind was unable to receive. The result was,
that, in 1782, Florida Blanca concluded a treaty with
Turkey, which put an end to the war of religious
opinions; to the astonishment, as we are told, of the
other European powers, who could hardly believe that
the Spaniards would thus abandon their long-continued
efforts to destroy the infidels.<a name="FNanchor_1438_1438" id="FNanchor_1438_1438"></a><a href="#Footnote_1438_1438" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a> Before, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
Europe had time to recover from its amazement, other
and similar events occurred equally startling. In 1784,
Spain signed a peace with Tripoli; and in 1785, one
with Algiers.<a name="FNanchor_1439_1439" id="FNanchor_1439_1439"></a><a href="#Footnote_1439_1439" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a> And scarcely had these been ratified,
when, in 1786, a treaty was also concluded with
Tunis.<a name="FNanchor_1440_1440" id="FNanchor_1440_1440"></a><a href="#Footnote_1440_1440" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a> So that the Spanish people to their no small
surprise, found themselves on terms of amity with
nations, whom for more than ten centuries they had
been taught to abhor, and whom, in the opinion of the
Spanish Church, it was the first duty of a Christian
government to make war upon, and, if possible, to
extirpate.</p>

<p>Putting aside, for a moment, the remote and intellectual
consequences of these transactions, there can be
no doubt that the immediate and material consequences
were very salutary; though, as we shall presently see,
they produced no lasting benefit, because they were
opposed by the unfavourable operation of more powerful
and more general causes. Still, it must be confessed
that the direct results were extremely advantageous;
and to those who take only a short view of human
affairs, it might well appear that the advantages would
be permanent. The immense line of coast from the
kingdoms of Fez and Morocco to the furthest extremity
of the Turkish empire was no longer allowed to pour
forth those innumerable pirates who, heretofore, swept
the seas, captured Spanish ships, and made slaves of
Spanish subjects. Formerly, vast sums of money were
annually consumed in ransoming these unhappy prisoners;<a name="FNanchor_1441_1441" id="FNanchor_1441_1441"></a><a href="#Footnote_1441_1441" class="fnanchor">[1441]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
but now all such evils were ended. At the
same time, great impetus was given to the commerce of
Spain; a new trade was thrown open, and her ships
could safely appear in the rich countries of the Levant.
This increased her wealth; which was moreover aided
by another circumstance growing out of these events.
For, the most fertile parts of Spain are those which are
washed by the Mediterranean, and which had for
centuries been the prey of Mohammedan corsairs, who
frequently landing by surprise, had at length caused
such constant fear, that the inhabitants gradually
retired towards the interior, and abstained from cultivating
the richest soil in their country. But, by the
treaties just concluded, such dangers were at once
removed; the people returned to their former abodes;
the earth again gave forth its fruits; regular industry
reappeared; villages sprung up; even manufactures
were established; and the foundation seemed to be
laid for a prosperity, the like of which had not been
known since the Mohammedans were driven out of
Granada.<a name="FNanchor_1442_1442" id="FNanchor_1442_1442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1442_1442" class="fnanchor">[1442]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span></p>

<p>I have now laid before the reader a view of the most
important steps which were taken by those able and
vigorous politicians, who ruled Spain during the
greater part of the eighteenth century. In considering
how these reforms were effected, we must not
forget the personal character of Charles III., who
occupied the throne from 1759 to 1788.<a name="FNanchor_1443_1443" id="FNanchor_1443_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1443_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a> He was a
man of great energy, and though born in Spain, had
little in common with it. When he became king, he had
been long absent from his native country, and had contracted
a taste for customs, and, above all, for opinions,
totally dissimilar to those natural to the Spaniards.<a name="FNanchor_1444_1444" id="FNanchor_1444_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1444_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
Comparing him with his subjects, he was enlightened
indeed. They cherished in their hearts, the most
complete, and therefore the worst, form of spiritual
power which has ever been exhibited in Europe. That
very power, he made it his business to restrain. In
this, as in other respects, he far surpassed Ferdinand
VI. and Philip V., though they, under the influence of
French ideas, had proceeded to what was deemed a
dangerous length.<a name="FNanchor_1445_1445" id="FNanchor_1445_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1445_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a> The clergy, indignant at such
proceedings, murmured, and even threatened.<a name="FNanchor_1446_1446" id="FNanchor_1446_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1446_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a> They
declared that Charles was despoiling the Church,
taking away her rights, insulting her ministers, and
thus ruining Spain beyond human remedy.<a name="FNanchor_1447_1447" id="FNanchor_1447_1447"></a><a href="#Footnote_1447_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a> The
king, however, whose disposition was firm, and somewhat
obstinate, persevered in his policy; and as he and
his ministers were men of undoubted ability, they,
notwithstanding the opposition they encountered, succeeded
in accomplishing most of their plans. Mistaken
and short-sighted though they were, it is impossible
to refrain from admiring the honesty, the courage, and
the disinterestedness, which they displayed in endeavouring
to alter the destiny of that superstitions
and half barbarous country over which they ruled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
We must not, however, conceal from ourselves, that in
this, as in all similar cases, they, by attacking evils
which the people were resolved to love, increased the
affection which the evils inspired. To seek to change
opinions by laws is worse than futile. It not only
fails, but it causes a reaction, which leaves the opinions
stronger than ever. First alter the opinion, and
then you may alter the law. As soon as you have convinced
men that superstition is mischievous, you may
with advantage take active steps against those classes
who promote superstition and live by it. But, however
pernicious any interest or any great body may be,
beware of using force against it, unless the progress
of knowledge has previously sapped it at its base, and
loosened its hold over the national mind. This has
always been the error of the most ardent reformers,
who, in their eagerness to effect their purpose, let the
political movement outstrip the intellectual one, and,
thus inverting the natural order, secure misery either
to themselves or to their descendants. They touch the
altar, and fire springs forth to consume them. Then
comes another period of superstition and of despotism;
another dark epoch in the annals of the human race.
And this happens merely because men will not bide
their time, but will insist on precipitating the march of
affairs. Thus, for instance, in France and Germany, it
is the friends of freedom who have strengthened
tyranny; it is the enemies of superstition who have
made superstition more permanent. In those countries,
it is still believed that government can regenerate
society; and therefore, directly they who hold liberal
opinions get possession of the government, they use
their power too lavishly, thinking that by doing so,
they will best secure the end at which they aim. In
England, the same delusion, though less general, is far
too prevalent; but as, with us, public opinion controls
politicians, we escape from evils which have happened
abroad, because we will not allow any government to
enact laws which the nation disapproves. In Spain,
however, the habits of the people were so slavish, and
their necks had so long been bowed under the yoke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
that though the government, in the eighteenth century,
opposed their dearest prejudices, they rarely ventured
to resist, and they had no legal means of making their
voice heard. But not the less did they feel. The
materials for reaction were silently accumulating; and
before that century had passed away the reaction itself
was manifest. As long as Charles III. lived, it was
kept under; and this was owing partly to the fear
which his active and vigorous government inspired,
and partly to the fact that many of the reforms which
he introduced were so obviously beneficial as to shed a
lustre on his reign, which all classes could perceive.
Besides the exemption which his policy insured from
the incessant ravages of pirates, he also succeeded in
obtaining for Spain the most honourable peace which
any Spanish government had signed for two centuries;
thus recalling to the popular mind the brightest and
most glorious days of Philip II.<a name="FNanchor_1448_1448" id="FNanchor_1448_1448"></a><a href="#Footnote_1448_1448" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a> When Charles
came to the throne, Spain was hardly a third-rate
power; when he died, she might fairly claim to be a
first-rate one, since she had for some years negotiated
on equal terms with France, England, and Austria,
and had taken a leading part in the councils of Europe.
To this, the personal character of Charles greatly
contributed; he being respected for his honesty, as well
as feared for his vigour.<a name="FNanchor_1449_1449" id="FNanchor_1449_1449"></a><a href="#Footnote_1449_1449" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a> Merely as a man, he
bore high repute; while, as a sovereign, none of his
contemporaries were in any way equal to him, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
Frederick of Prussia, whose vast abilities, were,
however, tarnished by a base rapacity, and by an incessant
desire to overreach his neighbours. Charles
III. had nothing of this; but he carefully increased
the defences of Spain, and, raising her establishments
to a war-footing, he made her more formidable than
she had been since the sixteenth century. Instead of
being liable to insult from every petty potentate who
chose to triumph over her weakness, the country had
now the means of resisting, and if need be, of attacking.
While the army was greatly improved in the
quality of the troops, in their discipline, and in the
attention paid to their comforts, the navy was nearly
doubled in number, and more than doubled in efficiency.<a name="FNanchor_1450_1450" id="FNanchor_1450_1450"></a><a href="#Footnote_1450_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a>
And this was done without imposing fresh
burdens on the people. Indeed, the national resources
were becoming so developed, that, in the reign of
Charles III., a large amount of taxation could have
been easier paid than a small one under his predecessors.
A regularity, hitherto unknown, was introduced
into the method both of assessing imposts, and of
collecting them.<a name="FNanchor_1451_1451" id="FNanchor_1451_1451"></a><a href="#Footnote_1451_1451" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a> The laws of mortmain were
relaxed, and steps were taken towards diminishing the
rigidity of entails.<a name="FNanchor_1452_1452" id="FNanchor_1452_1452"></a><a href="#Footnote_1452_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a> The industry of the country
was liberated from many of the trammels which had
long been imposed upon it, and the principles of free
trade were so far recognized, that, in 1765, the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
laws respecting corn were repealed; its exportation
was allowed, and also its transit from one part of
Spain to another, uninterrupted by those absurd precautions,
which preceding governments had thought it
advisable to invent.<a name="FNanchor_1453_1453" id="FNanchor_1453_1453"></a><a href="#Footnote_1453_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a></p>

<p>It was also in the reign of Charles III. that the
American Colonies were, for the first time, treated according
to the maxims of a wise and liberal policy.
The behaviour of the Spanish government in this
respect, contrasts most favourably with the conduct
pursued at the same time towards our great Colonies
by that narrow and incompetent man who then filled
the English throne. While the violence of George III.
was fomenting rebellion in the British Colonies,
Charles III. was busily engaged in conciliating the
Spanish ones. Towards this end, and with the object
of giving fair play to the growth of their wealth, he
did everything which the knowledge and resources of
that age allowed him to do. In 1764, he accomplished,
what was then considered the great feat of establishing
every month a regular communication with
America, in order that the reforms which he projected
might be more easily introduced, and the grievances of
the Colonies attended to.<a name="FNanchor_1454_1454" id="FNanchor_1454_1454"></a><a href="#Footnote_1454_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a> In the very next year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
free trade was conceded to the West Indian Islands,
whose abundant commodities were now, for the first
time, allowed to circulate, to their own benefit, as well
as to the benefit of their neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_1455_1455" id="FNanchor_1455_1455"></a><a href="#Footnote_1455_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a> Into the
Colonies generally, vast improvements were introduced,
many oppressions were removed, the tyranny of
officials was checked, and the burdens of the people
were lightened.<a name="FNanchor_1456_1456" id="FNanchor_1456_1456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1456_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a> Finally, in 1778, the principles of
free trade having been successfully tried in the
American Islands, were now extended to the American
Continent; the ports of Peru and of New Spain were
thrown open; and by this means an immense impetus
was given to the prosperity of those magnificent
colonies, which nature intended to be rich, but which
the meddling folly of man had forced to be poor.<a name="FNanchor_1457_1457" id="FNanchor_1457_1457"></a><a href="#Footnote_1457_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a></p>

<p>All this reacted upon the mother country with such
rapidity, that scarcely was the old system of monopoly
broken up, when the trade of Spain began to advance,
and continued to improve, until the exports and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
imports had reached a height that even the authors of
the reform could hardly have expected; it being said
that the export of foreign commodities was tripled,
that the export of home-produce was multiplied fivefold,
and the returns from America ninefold.<a name="FNanchor_1458_1458" id="FNanchor_1458_1458"></a><a href="#Footnote_1458_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a></p>

<p>Many of the taxes, which bore heavily on the lower
ranks, were repealed, and the industrious classes, being
relieved of their principal burdens, it was hoped that
their condition would speedily improve.<a name="FNanchor_1459_1459" id="FNanchor_1459_1459"></a><a href="#Footnote_1459_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a> And to
benefit them still more, such alterations were effected
in the administration of the law, as might enable them
to receive justice from the public tribunals, when they
had occasion to complain of their superiors. Hitherto,
a poor man had not the least chance of succeeding
against a rich one; but in the reign of Charles III.,
government introduced various regulations, by which
labourers and mechanics could obtain redress, if their
masters defrauded them of their wages, or broke the
contracts made with them.<a name="FNanchor_1460_1460" id="FNanchor_1460_1460"></a><a href="#Footnote_1460_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a></p>

<p>Not only the labouring classes, but also the literary
and scientific classes, were encouraged and protected.
One source of danger, to which they had long been
exposed, was considerably lessened by the steps which
Charles took to curtail the power of the Inquisition.
The king, was, moreover, always ready to reward
them; he was a man of cultivated tastes, and he delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
in being thought the patron of learning.<a name="FNanchor_1461_1461" id="FNanchor_1461_1461"></a><a href="#Footnote_1461_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a>
Soon after his accession, he issued an order, exempting
from military service all printers, and all persons immediately
connected with printing, such as casters of
type, and the like.<a name="FNanchor_1462_1462" id="FNanchor_1462_1462"></a><a href="#Footnote_1462_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a> He, also, as far as he was able,
infused new life into the old universities, and did all
that was possible towards restoring their discipline and
reputation.<a name="FNanchor_1463_1463" id="FNanchor_1463_1463"></a><a href="#Footnote_1463_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a> He founded schools, endowed colleges,
rewarded professors, and granted pensions. In these
matters his munificence seemed inexhaustible, and is of
itself sufficient to account for the veneration with which
literary Spaniards regard his memory. They have
reason to regret that, instead of living now, they had
not lived when he was king. In his reign, it was
supposed that their interests must be identical with the
interests of knowledge; and these last were rated so
highly, that, in 1771, it was laid down as a settled
principle of government, that of all the branches of
public policy, the care of education is the most important.<a name="FNanchor_1464_1464" id="FNanchor_1464_1464"></a><a href="#Footnote_1464_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a></p>

<p>But this is not all. It is no exaggeration to say, that
in the reign of Charles III., the face of Spain underwent
greater changes than it had done during the hundred
and fifty years which had elapsed since the final expulsion
of the Mohammedans. At his accession, in 1759,
the wise and pacific policy of his predecessor, Ferdinand
VI., had enabled that prince not only to pay many of
the debts owed by the crown, but also to accumulate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
leave behind him a considerable treasure.<a name="FNanchor_1465_1465" id="FNanchor_1465_1465"></a><a href="#Footnote_1465_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a> Of this
Charles availed himself, to begin those works of public
splendour, which, more than any other part of his administration,
was sure to strike the senses, and to give
popularity to his reign. And when, by the increase of
wealth, rather than by the imposition of fresh burdens,
still larger resources were placed at his command, he
devoted a considerable part of them to completing his
designs. He so beautified Madrid, that forty years after
his death, it was stated, that, as it then stood, all its
magnificence was owing to him. The public buildings
and the public gardens, the beautiful walks round the
capital, its noble gates, its institutions, and the very
roads leading from it to the adjacent country, are all
the work of Charles III., and are among the most conspicuous
trophies which attest his genius and the sumptuousness
of his taste.<a name="FNanchor_1466_1466" id="FNanchor_1466_1466"></a><a href="#Footnote_1466_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a></p>

<p>In other parts of the country, roads were laid down,
and canals were dug, with the view of increasing trade
by opening up communications through tracts previously
impassable. At the accession of Charles III., the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
of the Sierra Morena was unoccupied, except by wild
beasts and banditti, who took refuge there.<a name="FNanchor_1467_1467" id="FNanchor_1467_1467"></a><a href="#Footnote_1467_1467" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a> No peaceful
traveller would venture into such a place; and commerce
was thus excluded from what nature had marked
as one of the greatest highways in Spain, standing
as it does between the basins of the Guadiana and
Guadalquivir, and in the direct course between the
ports on the Mediterranean and those on the Atlantic.
The active government of Charles III. determined to
remedy this evil; but the Spanish people not having
the energy to do what was required, six thousand Dutch
and Flemish were, in 1767, invited to settle in the
Sierra Morena. On their arrival, lands were allotted to
them, roads were cut through the whole of the district,
villages were built; and that which had just been an
impervious desert, was suddenly turned into a smiling
and fruitful territory.<a name="FNanchor_1468_1468" id="FNanchor_1468_1468"></a><a href="#Footnote_1468_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a></p>

<p>Nearly all over Spain, the roads were repaired; a
fund having been, so early as 1760, specially set apart
for that purpose.<a name="FNanchor_1469_1469" id="FNanchor_1469_1469"></a><a href="#Footnote_1469_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a> Many new works were begun;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
and such improvements were introduced, while at the
same time, such vigilance was employed to prevent
peculation on the part of officials, that in a very few
years the cost of making public highways was reduced
to less than half of what it used to be.<a name="FNanchor_1470_1470" id="FNanchor_1470_1470"></a><a href="#Footnote_1470_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a> Of the undertakings
which were brought to a successful issue, the
most important were, a road now first constructed from
Malaga to Antequera,<a name="FNanchor_1471_1471" id="FNanchor_1471_1471"></a><a href="#Footnote_1471_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a> and another from Aquilas to
Lorca.<a name="FNanchor_1472_1472" id="FNanchor_1472_1472"></a><a href="#Footnote_1472_1472" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a> In this way, means of intercourse were supplied
between the Mediterranean and the interior of
Andalusia and of Mercia. While these communications
were established in the south and south-east of Spain,
others were opened up in the north and north-west. In
1769, a road was begun between Bilbao and Osma;<a name="FNanchor_1473_1473" id="FNanchor_1473_1473"></a><a href="#Footnote_1473_1473" class="fnanchor">[1473]</a>
and soon after, one was completed between Galicia and
Astorga.<a name="FNanchor_1474_1474" id="FNanchor_1474_1474"></a><a href="#Footnote_1474_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a> These and similar works were so skilfully
executed, that the Spanish highways, formerly among
the worst in Europe, were now classed among the best.
Indeed, a competent, and by no means over-friendly,
judge gives it as his opinion, that at the death of Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
III. better roads were to be found in Spain than in any
other country.<a name="FNanchor_1475_1475" id="FNanchor_1475_1475"></a><a href="#Footnote_1475_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a></p>

<p>In the interior, rivers were made navigable, and
canals were formed to connect them with each other.
The Ebro runs through the heart of Aragon and part
of Old Castile, and is available for purposes of traffic as
high up as Logroño, and from thence down to Tudela.
But between Tudela and Saragossa, the navigation is
interrupted by its great speed, and by the rocks in its
bed. Consequently, Navarre is deprived of its natural
communication with the Mediterranean. In the enterprising
reign of Charles V., an attempt was made to
remedy this evil; but the plan failed, was laid aside,
and was forgotten, until it was revived, more than two
hundred years later, by Charles III. Under his auspices,
the great canal of Aragon was projected, with the magnificent
idea of uniting the Mediterranean and the
Atlantic. This, however, was one of many instances in
which the government of Spain was too far in advance
of Spain itself; and it was necessary to abandon a
scheme, to which the resources of the country were unequal.
But what was really effected, was of immense
value. A canal was actually carried to Saragossa, and
the waters of the Ebro were made available not only
for transport, but also for irrigating the soil. The
means of a safe and profitable trade were now supplied
even to the western extremity of Aragon. The old land,
becoming more productive, rose in value, and new land
was brought under the plough. From this, other parts
of Spain also benefited. Castile, for example, had in
seasons of scarcity always depended for supplies on
Aragon, though that province could, under the former
system, only produce enough for its own consumption.
But by this great canal, to which, about the same time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
that of Tauste was also added,<a name="FNanchor_1476_1476" id="FNanchor_1476_1476"></a><a href="#Footnote_1476_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a> the soil of Aragon became
far more productive than it had ever yet been; and
the rich plains of the Ebro yielded so abundantly, that
they were able to supply wheat and other food to the
Castilians, as well as to the Aragonese.<a name="FNanchor_1477_1477" id="FNanchor_1477_1477"></a><a href="#Footnote_1477_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a></p>

<p>The government of Charles III., moreover, constructed
a canal between Amposta and Alfaques,<a name="FNanchor_1478_1478" id="FNanchor_1478_1478"></a><a href="#Footnote_1478_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a>
which irrigated the southern extremity of Catalonia,
and brought into cultivation a large district, which,
from the constant lack of rain, had hitherto been
untilled. Another and still greater enterprise belonging
to the same reign, was an attempt, only partly successful,
to establish a water-communication between the capital
and the Atlantic, by running a canal from Madrid to
Toledo, whence the Tagus would have conveyed goods
to Lisbon, and all the trade of the west would have
been opened up.<a name="FNanchor_1479_1479" id="FNanchor_1479_1479"></a><a href="#Footnote_1479_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a> But this and many other noble
projects were nipped in the bud by the death of Charles
III., with whom every thing vanished. When he
passed away, the country relapsed into its former inactivity,
and it was clearly seen that these great works
were not national, but political; in other words that
they were due merely to individuals, whose most
strenuous exertions always come to naught, if they
are opposed by the operation of those general causes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
which are often undiscerned, but to which even the
strongest of us, do, in our own despite, pay implicit
obedience.</p>

<p>Still for a time much was done; and Charles, reasoning
according to the ordinary maxims of politicians,
might well indulge the hope, that what he had effected
would permanently change the destiny of Spain. For
these and other works which he not only planned but
executed,<a name="FNanchor_1480_1480" id="FNanchor_1480_1480"></a><a href="#Footnote_1480_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a> were not paid for, as is too often the case,
by taxes which oppressed the people, and trammelled
their industry. At his side, and constantly advising
him, there were men who really aimed at the public
good, and who never would have committed so fatal an
error. Under his rule the wealth of the country greatly
increased, and the comforts of the lower classes, instead
of being abridged, were multiplied. The imposts were
more fairly assessed than they had ever been before.
Taxes, which, in the seventeenth century, all the power
of the executive could not wring from the people, were
now regularly paid, and, owing to the development of
the national resources, they became at once more productive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
and less onerous. In the management of the
public finances, an economy was practised, the first
example of which had been set in the preceding reign,
when the cautious and pacific policy of Ferdinand VI.
laid a foundation for many of the improvements just
narrated. Ferdinand bequeathed to Charles III. a
treasure which he had not extorted, but saved. Among
the reforms which he introduced, and which an unwillingness
to accumulate details has compelled me to
omit, there is one very important, and also very characteristic
of his policy. Before his reign, Spain had
annually been drained of an immense amount of money,
on account of the right which the Pope claimed of
presenting to certain rich benefices, and of receiving
part of their produce; probably as a recompense for the
trouble he had taken. Of this duty the Pope was
relieved by Ferdinand VI., who secured to the Spanish
crown the right of conferring such preferment, and
thus saved to the country those enormous sums on
which the Roman Court had been wont to revel.<a name="FNanchor_1481_1481" id="FNanchor_1481_1481"></a><a href="#Footnote_1481_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a>
This was just the sort of measure which would be
hailed with delight by Charles III., as harmonizing
with his own views; and we accordingly find, that, in
his reign, it was not only acted upon, but extended still
further. For, perceiving that, in spite of his efforts,
the feeling of the Spaniards on these matters was so
strong as to impel them to make offerings to him whom
they venerated as the Head of the Church, the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
determined to exercise control over even these voluntary
gifts. To accomplish this end, various devices
were suggested; and at length one was hit upon,
which was thought sure to be effectual. A royal order
was issued, directing that no person should send money
to Rome, but that if he had occasion to make remittances
there, they should pass not through the ordinary
channels, but through the ambassadors, ministers, or
other agents of the Spanish crown.<a name="FNanchor_1482_1482" id="FNanchor_1482_1482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1482_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a></p>

<p>If we now review the transactions which I have narrated,
and consider them as a whole, extending from
the accession of Philip V. to the death of Charles III.,
over a period of nearly ninety years, we shall be struck
with wonder at their unity, at the regularity of their
march, and at their apparent success. Looking at them
merely in a political point of view, it may be doubted if
such vast and uninterrupted progress has ever been seen
in any country either before or since. For three
generations, there was no pause on the part of the
government; not one reaction, not one sign of halting.
Improvement upon improvement, and reform upon
reform, followed each other in swift succession. The
power of the Church, which has always been the
crying evil of Spain, and which hitherto none of the
boldest politicians had dared to touch, was restricted in
every possible way, by a series of statesmen, from Orry
to Florida Blanca, whose efforts were latterly, and for
nearly thirty years, zealously aided by Charles III., the
ablest monarch who has sat on the throne since the
death of Philip II. Even the Inquisition was taught
to tremble, and made to loosen its hold over its victims.
The burning of heretics was stopped. Torture was
disused. Prosecutions for heresy were discouraged.
Instead of punishing men for imaginary offences, a
disposition was shown to attend to their real interests,
to alleviate their burdens, to increase their comforts,
and to check the tyranny of those who were set over
them. Attempts were made to restrain the cupidity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
the clergy, and prevent them from preying at will upon
the national wealth. With this view, the laws of
mortmain were revised, and various measures taken to
interpose obstacles in the way of persons who desired
to waste their property by bequeathing it for ecclesiastical
purposes. In this, as in other matters, the true
interests of society were preferred to the fictitious ones.
To raise the secular classes above the spiritual; to
discountenance the exclusive attention hitherto paid to
questions respecting which nothing is known, and
which it is impossible to solve; to do this, and, in the
place of such barren speculations, to substitute a taste
for science, or for literature, became the object of the
Spanish government for the first time since Spain had
possessed a government at all. As part of the same
scheme, the Jesuits were expelled, the right of sanctuary
was infringed, and the whole hierarchy, from the
highest bishop down to the lowest monk, were taught
to fear the law, to curb their passions, and to restrain
the insolence with which they had formerly treated
every rank except their own. These would have been
great deeds in any country; in such a country as Spain,
they were marvellous. Of them I have given an
abridged, and therefore an imperfect, account, but still
sufficient to show how the government laboured to
diminish superstition, to check bigotry, to stimulate
intellect, to promote industry, and to rouse the people
from their death-like slumber. I have omitted many
measures of considerable interest, and which tended in
the same direction; because, here, as elsewhere, I seek
to confine myself to those salient points which most
distinctly mark the general movement. Whoever will
minutely study the history of Spain during this period,
will find additional proof of the skill and vigour of
those who were at the head of affairs, and who devoted
their best energies to regenerating the country which
they ruled. But, for these special studies, special men
are required; and I shall be satisfied, if I have firmly
grasped the great march and outline of the whole. It
is enough for my purpose, if I have substantiated the
general proposition, and have convinced the reader of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
the clearness with which the statesmen of Spain
discerned the evils under which their country was
groaning, and of the zeal with which they set themselves
to remedy the mischief, and to resuscitate the fortunes
of what had once not only been the chief of European
monarchies, but had borne sway over the most splendid
and extensive territory that had been united under a
single rule since the fall of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>They who believe that a government can civilize a
nation, and that legislators are the cause of social progress,
will naturally expect that Spain reaped permanent
benefit from those liberal maxims, which now, for the
first time, were put into execution. The fact, however,
is, that such a policy, wise as it appeared, was of no
avail, simply because it ran counter to the whole train
of preceding circumstances. It was opposed to the
habits of the national mind, and was introduced into a
state of society not yet ripe for it. No reform can
produce real good, unless it is the work of public
opinion, and unless the people themselves take the
initiative. In Spain, during the eighteenth century,
foreign influence, and the complications of foreign
politics, bestowed enlightened rulers upon an unenlightened
country.<a name="FNanchor_1483_1483" id="FNanchor_1483_1483"></a><a href="#Footnote_1483_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a> The consequence was, that, for a
time, great things were done. Evils were removed,
grievances were redressed, many important improvements
were introduced; and a spirit of toleration was
exhibited, such as had never before been seen in that
priest-ridden and superstitious land. But the mind of
Spain was untouched. While the surface, and as it
were the symptoms, of affairs were ameliorated, affairs
themselves remained unchanged. Below that surface,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
and far out of reach of any political remedy, large
general causes were at work, which had been operating
for many centuries, and which were sure, sooner or
later, to force politicians to retrace their steps, and
compel them to inaugurate a policy which would
suit the traditions of the country, and harmonize with
the circumstances under which those traditions had
been formed.</p>

<p>At length the reaction came. In 1788, Charles III.
died; and was succeeded by Charles IV., a king of the
true Spanish breed, devout, orthodox, and ignorant.<a name="FNanchor_1484_1484" id="FNanchor_1484_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_1484_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a>
It was now seen how insecure everything was, and how
little reliance can be placed on reforms, which, instead
of being suggested by the people, are bestowed on them
by the political classes. Charles IV., though a weak
and contemptible prince,<a name="FNanchor_1485_1485" id="FNanchor_1485_1485"></a><a href="#Footnote_1485_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a> was so supported in his
general views by the feelings of the Spanish nation,
that, in less than five years, he was able completely to
reverse that liberal policy which it had taken three
generations of statesmen to build up. In less than five
years everything was changed. The power of the
Church was restored; the slightest approach towards
free discussion was forbidden; old and arbitrary principles,
which had not been heard of since the seventeenth
century, were revived; the priests re-assumed their
former importance; literary men were intimidated, and
literature was discouraged; while the Inquisition, suddenly
starting up afresh, displayed an energy, which
caused its enemies to tremble, and proved that all the
attempts which had been made to weaken it, had been
unable to impair its vigour, or to daunt its ancient
spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span></p>

<p>The ministers of Charles III., and the authors of
those great reforms which signalized his reign, were
dismissed, to make way for other advisers, better suited
to this new state of things. Charles IV. loved the
Church too well to tolerate the presence of enlightened
statesmen. Aranda and Florida Blanca were both removed
from office, and both were placed in confinement.<a name="FNanchor_1486_1486" id="FNanchor_1486_1486"></a><a href="#Footnote_1486_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a>
Jovellanos was banished from court, and
Cabarrus was thrown into prison.<a name="FNanchor_1487_1487" id="FNanchor_1487_1487"></a><a href="#Footnote_1487_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a> For, now, work
had to be done, to which these eminent men would not
put their hands. A policy which had been followed
with undeviating consistency for nearly ninety years,
was about to be rescinded, in order that the old empire
of the seventeenth century, which was the empire of
ignorance, of tyranny, and of superstition, might be
resuscitated, and, if possible, restored to its pristine
vigour.</p>

<p>Once more was Spain covered with darkness; once
more did the shadows of night overtake that wretched
land. The worst forms of oppression, says a distinguished
writer, seemed to be settling on the country with a new
and portentous weight.<a name="FNanchor_1488_1488" id="FNanchor_1488_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a> At the same time, and indeed
as a natural part of the scheme, every investigation
likely to stimulate the mind, was prohibited, and an
order was actually sent to all the universities, forbidding
the study of moral philosophy; the minister, who issued
the order, justly observing, that the king did not want
to have philosophers.<a name="FNanchor_1489_1489" id="FNanchor_1489_1489"></a><a href="#Footnote_1489_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a> There was, however, little fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
of Spain producing anything so dangerous. The nation
not daring, and, what was still worse, not wishing,
to resist, gave way, and let the king do as he liked.
Within a very few years, he neutralized the most valuable
reforms which his predecessors had introduced.
Having discarded the able advisers of his father, he
conferred the highest posts upon men as narrow and
incompetent as himself; he reduced the country to the
verge of bankruptcy; and, according to the remark of
a Spanish historian, he exhausted all the resources of
the state.<a name="FNanchor_1490_1490" id="FNanchor_1490_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a></p>

<p>Such was the condition of Spain, late in the eighteenth
century. The French invasion quickly followed;
and that unhappy country underwent every form of
calamity and of degradation. Herein, however, lies a difference.
Calamities may be inflicted by others; but no
people can be degraded except by their own acts. The
foreign spoiler works mischief; he cannot cause shame.
With nations, as with individuals, none are dishonoured
if they are true to themselves. Spain, during the present
century, has been plundered and oppressed, and
the opprobrium lights on the robbers, not on the robbed.
She has been overrun by a brutal and licentious soldiery;
her fields laid waste, her towns sacked, her villages
burned. It is to the criminal, rather than to the victim,
that the ignominy of these acts must belong. And,
even in a material point of view, such losses are sure to
be retrieved, if the people who incur them are inured to
those habits of self-government, and to that feeling of
self-reliance, which are the spring and the source of all
real greatness. With the aid of these, every damage
may be repaired, and every evil remedied. Without
them, the slightest blow may be fatal. In Spain, they
are unknown; and it seems impossible to establish
them. In that country, men have so long been accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
to pay implicit deference to the Crown and the
Church, that loyalty and superstition have usurped the
place of those nobler emotions, to which all freedom is
owing, and in the absence of which, the true idea of
independence can never be attained.</p>

<p>More than once, indeed, during the nineteenth century,
a spirit has appeared, from which better things
might have been augured. In 1812, in 1820, and in
1836, a few ardent and enthusiastic reformers attempted
to secure liberty to the Spanish people, by endowing
Spain with a free constitution. They succeeded for a
moment, and that was all. The forms of constitutional
government they could bestow; but they could not find
the traditions and the habits, by which the forms are
worked. They mimicked the voice of liberty; they
copied her institutions; they aped her very gestures.
And what then? At the first stroke of adverse fortune,
their idol fell to pieces. Their constitutions were broken
up, their assemblies dissolved, their enactments rescinded.
The inevitable reaction quickly followed. After each
disturbance, the hands of the government were strengthened,
the principles of despotism were confirmed, and
the Spanish liberals were taught to rue the day, in which
they vainly endeavoured to impart freedom to their
unhappy and ill-starred country.<a name="FNanchor_1491_1491" id="FNanchor_1491_1491"></a><a href="#Footnote_1491_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span></p>

<p>What makes these failures the more worthy of observation
is, that the Spaniards did possess, at a very
early period, municipal privileges and franchises, similar
to those which we had in England, and to which our
greatness is often ascribed. But such institutions, though
they preserve freedom, can never create it. Spain had
the form of liberty without its spirit; hence the form,
promising as it was, soon died away. In England, the
spirit preceded the form, and therefore the form was
durable. Thus it is, that though the Spaniards could
boast of free institutions a century before ourselves,
they were unable to retain them, simply because they
had the institutions and nothing more. We had no
popular representation till 1264;<a name="FNanchor_1492_1492" id="FNanchor_1492_1492"></a><a href="#Footnote_1492_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a> but in Castile they
had it in 1169,<a name="FNanchor_1493_1493" id="FNanchor_1493_1493"></a><a href="#Footnote_1493_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a> and in Aragon in 1133.<a name="FNanchor_1494_1494" id="FNanchor_1494_1494"></a><a href="#Footnote_1494_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a> So, too,
while the earliest charter was granted to an English
town in the twelfth century,<a name="FNanchor_1495_1495" id="FNanchor_1495_1495"></a><a href="#Footnote_1495_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a> we find, in Spain, a
charter conferred on Leon as early as 1020; and in the
course of the eleventh century the enfranchisement of
towns was as secure as laws could make it.<a name="FNanchor_1496_1496" id="FNanchor_1496_1496"></a><a href="#Footnote_1496_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a></p>

<p>The fact, however, is, that in Spain these institutions,
instead of growing out of the wants of the people
originated in a stroke of policy on the part of their
rulers. They were conceded to the citizens, rather
than desired by them. For, during the war with the
Mohammedans, the Christian kings of Spain, as they
advanced southwards, were naturally anxious to induce
their subjects to settle in the frontier towns, where they
might face and repel the enemy. With this object they
granted charters to the towns, and privileges to the
inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_1497_1497" id="FNanchor_1497_1497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1497_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a> And as the Mohammedans were gradually
beaten back from the Asturias to Granada, the
frontiers changed, and the franchises were extended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
the new conquests, in order that what was the post of
danger, might also be the place of reward. But, meanwhile,
those general causes, which I have indicated,
were predetermining the nation to habits of loyalty and
of superstition, which grew to a height fatal to the
spirit of liberty. That being the case the institutions
were of no avail. They took no root; and as they were
originated by one political combination, they were destroyed
by another. Before the close of the fourteenth
century, the Spaniards were so firmly seated in the territories
they had lately acquired that there was little
danger of their being again expelled<a name="FNanchor_1498_1498" id="FNanchor_1498_1498"></a><a href="#Footnote_1498_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a> while, on the
other hand, there was no immediate prospect of their
being able to push their conquests further, and drive
the Mohammedans from the strongholds of Granada.
The circumstances, therefore, which gave rise to the
municipal privileges had changed; and as soon as this
was apparent, the privileges began to perish. Being
unsuited to the habits of the people, they were sure to
fall, on the first opportunity.<a name="FNanchor_1499_1499" id="FNanchor_1499_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a> Late in the fourteenth
century, their decline was perceptible; by the close of
the fifteenth century, they were almost extinct; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
early in the sixteenth century, they were finally overthrown.<a name="FNanchor_1500_1500" id="FNanchor_1500_1500"></a><a href="#Footnote_1500_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a></p>

<p>It is thus that general causes eventually triumph
over every obstacle. In the average of affairs, and on
a comparison of long periods, they are irresistible.
Their operation is often attacked, and occasionally, for
a little time, stopped by politicians, who are always
ready with their empirical and short-sighted remedies.
But when the spirit of the age is against those
remedies, they can at best only succeed for a moment;
and after that moment has passed, a reaction sets in,
and the penalty for violence has to be paid. Evidence
of this will be found in the annals of every civilized
country, by whoever will confront the history of legislation
with the history of opinion. The fate of the
Spanish towns has afforded us one good proof; the
fate of the Spanish Church will supply us with
another. For more than eighty years after the death of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
Charles II. the rulers of Spain attempted to weaken
the ecclesiastical power; and the end of all their efforts
was, that even such an insignificant and incompetent
king as Charles IV. was able, with the greatest ease,
rapidly to undo what they had done. This is because,
during the eighteenth century, while the clergy were
assailed by law, they were favoured by opinion. The
opinions of a people invariably depend on large
general causes, which influence the whole country;
but their laws are too often the work of a few powerful
individuals, in opposition to the national will. When
the legislators die, or lose office, there is always a
chance of their successors holding opposite views, and
subverting their plans. In the midst, however, of this
play and fluctuation of political life, the general causes
remain steady, though they are often kept out of
sight, and do not become visible, until politicians, inclining
to their side, bring them to the surface, and
invest them with open and public authority.</p>

<p>This is what Charles IV. did in Spain; and when
he took measures to favour the Church, and to discourage
free inquiry, he merely sanctioned those
national habits which his predecessors had disregarded.
The hold which the hierarchy of that country possess
over public opinion has always been proverbial; but it
is even greater than is commonly supposed. What it
was in the seventeenth century, we have already seen;
and in the eighteenth century, there were no signs of
its diminution, except among a few bold men, who
could effect nothing, while the popular voice was so
strong against them. Early in the reign of Philip V.,
Labat, who travelled in Spain, informs us, that when
a priest performed mass, nobles of the highest rank
deemed it an honour to help him to dress, and that they
would go down on their knees to him, and kiss his
hands.<a name="FNanchor_1501_1501" id="FNanchor_1501_1501"></a><a href="#Footnote_1501_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a> When this was done by the proudest aristocracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
in Europe, we may suppose what the general
feeling must have been. Indeed, Labat assures us,
that a Spaniard would hardly be considered of
sound faith, if he did not leave some portion of his
property to the Church; so completely had respect for
the hierarchy become an essential part of the national
character.<a name="FNanchor_1502_1502" id="FNanchor_1502_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_1502_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a></p>

<p>A still more curious instance was exhibited on the
occasion of the expulsion of the Jesuits. That once
useful, but now troublesome, body was, during the
eighteenth century, what it is in the nineteenth&mdash;the
obstinate enemy of progress and of toleration. The
rulers of Spain, observing that it opposed all their
schemes of reform, resolved to get rid of an obstacle,
which met them at every turn. In France, the Jesuits
had just been treated as a public nuisance, and suppressed
at a blow, and without difficulty. The
advisers of Charles III. saw no reason why so salutary
a measure should not be imitated in their country; and,
in 1767, they, following the example which had been
set by the French in 1764, abolished this great mainstay
of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_1503_1503" id="FNanchor_1503_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1503_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a> Having done this, the government
supposed that it had taken a decisive step
towards weakening ecclesiastical power, particularly as
the sovereign cordially approved of the proceeding.
The year after this occurred, Charles III., according to
his custom, appeared in the balcony of the palace, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
the festival of St. Charles, ready to grant any request
which the people might make to him, and which
usually consisted of a prayer for the dismissal of a
minister, or for the repeal of a tax. On this occasion,
however, the citizens of Madrid, instead of occupying
themselves with such worldly matters, felt that still
dearer interests were in peril; and, to the surprise and
terror of the court, they demanded, with one voice,
that the Jesuits should be allowed to return, and wear
their usual dress, in order that Spain might be gladdened
by the sight of these holy men.<a name="FNanchor_1504_1504" id="FNanchor_1504_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a></p>

<p>What can you do with a nation like this? What is
the use of laws when the current of public opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
thus sets in against them? In the face of such
obstacles, the government of Charles III., notwithstanding
its good intentions, was powerless. Indeed,
it was worse than powerless: it did harm; for, by
rousing popular sympathy in favour of the Church, it
strengthened what it sought to weaken. On that
cruel and persecuting Church, stained as it was with
every sort of crime, the Spanish nation continued to
bestow marks of affection, which, instead of being
diminished, were increased. Gifts and legacies flowed
in freely and from every side; men being willing to
beggar themselves and their families, in order to swell
the general contribution. And to such a height was
this carried, that, in 1788, Florida Blanca, minister of
the crown, stated that, within the last fifty years, the
ecclesiastical revenues had increased so rapidly, that
many of them had doubled in value.<a name="FNanchor_1505_1505" id="FNanchor_1505_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a></p>

<p>Even the Inquisition, the most barbarous institution
which the wit of man has ever devised, was upheld by
public opinion against the attacks of the crown. The
Spanish government wished to overthrow it, and did
everything to weaken it; but the Spanish people loved
it as of old, and cherished it as their best protection
against the inroads of heresy.<a name="FNanchor_1506_1506" id="FNanchor_1506_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1506_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a> An illustration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
this was exhibited in 1778, when, on occasion of a
heretic being sentenced by the Inquisition, several of
the leading nobles attended as servants, being glad to
have an opportunity of publicly displaying their obedience
and docility to the Church.<a name="FNanchor_1507_1507" id="FNanchor_1507_1507"></a><a href="#Footnote_1507_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a></p>

<p>All these things were natural, and in order. They
were the result of a long train of causes, the operation
of which I have endeavoured to trace, during thirteen
centuries, since the outbreak of the Arian war. Those
causes forced the Spaniards to be superstitious, and it
was idle mockery to seek to change their nature by
legislation. The only remedy for superstition is knowledge.
Nothing else can wipe out that plague-spot of
the human mind. Without it, the leper remains unwashed,
and the slave unfreed. It is to a knowledge
of the laws and relations of things, that European civilization
is owing; but it is precisely this in which Spain
has always been deficient. And until that deficiency
is remedied, until science, with her bold and inquisitive
spirit, has established her right to investigate all subjects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
after her own fashion, and according to her own
method, we may be assured that, in Spain, neither
literature, nor universities, nor legislators, nor reformers
of any kind, will ever be able to rescue the
people from that helpless and benighted condition into
which the course of affairs has plunged them.</p>

<p>That no great political improvement, however plausible
or attractive it may appear, can be productive of
lasting benefit, unless it is preceded by a change in public
opinion, and that every change of public opinion is
preceded by changes in knowledge, are propositions
which all history verifies, but which are particularly
obvious in the history of Spain. The Spaniards have
had everything except knowledge. They have had
immense wealth, and fertile and well-peopled territories,
in all parts of the globe. Their own country,
washed by the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and
possessed of excellent harbours, is admirably situated
for the purposes of trade between Europe and America,
being so placed as to command the commerce of both
hemispheres.<a name="FNanchor_1508_1508" id="FNanchor_1508_1508"></a><a href="#Footnote_1508_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a> They had, at a very early period,
ample municipal privileges; they had independent
parliaments; they had the right of choosing their own
magistrates, and managing their own cities. They
have had rich and flourishing towns, abundant manufactures,
and skilful artizans, whose choice productions
could secure a ready sale in every market in the world.
They have cultivated the fine arts with eminent success;
their noble and exquisite paintings, and their
magnificent churches, being justly ranked among the
most wonderful efforts of the human hand. They
speak a beautiful, sonorous, and flexible language, and
their literature is not unworthy of their language.
Their soil yields treasures of every kind. It overflows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
with wine and oil, and produces the choicest fruits in
an almost tropical exuberance.<a name="FNanchor_1509_1509" id="FNanchor_1509_1509"></a><a href="#Footnote_1509_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a> It contains the most
valuable minerals, in a profuse variety unexampled in
any other part of Europe. No where else do we find
such rare and costly marbles, so easily accessible, and
in such close communication with the sea, where they
might safely be shipped, and sent to countries which
require them.<a name="FNanchor_1510_1510" id="FNanchor_1510_1510"></a><a href="#Footnote_1510_1510" class="fnanchor">[1510]</a> As to the metals, there is hardly one
which Spain does not possess in large quantities. Her
mines of silver and of quicksilver are well known.
She abounds in copper,<a name="FNanchor_1511_1511" id="FNanchor_1511_1511"></a><a href="#Footnote_1511_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a> and her supply of lead is
enormous.<a name="FNanchor_1512_1512" id="FNanchor_1512_1512"></a><a href="#Footnote_1512_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a> Iron and coal, the two most useful of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
the productions of the inorganic world,<a name="FNanchor_1513_1513" id="FNanchor_1513_1513"></a><a href="#Footnote_1513_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a> are also
abundant in that highly favoured country. Iron is
said to exist in every part of Spain, and to be of the
best quality;<a name="FNanchor_1514_1514" id="FNanchor_1514_1514"></a><a href="#Footnote_1514_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a> while the coal-mines of Asturias are
described as inexhaustible.<a name="FNanchor_1515_1515" id="FNanchor_1515_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_1515_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a> In short, nature has
been so prodigal of her bounty, that it has been
observed, with hardly an hyperbole, that the Spanish
nation possesses within itself nearly every natural production
which can satisfy either the necessity or the
curiosity of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_1516_1516" id="FNanchor_1516_1516"></a><a href="#Footnote_1516_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a></p>

<p>These are splendid gifts; it is for the historian to
tell how they have been used. Certainly, the people
who possess them have never been deficient in natural
endowments. They have had their full share of great
statesmen, great kings, great magistrates, and great
legislators. They have had many able and vigorous
rulers; and their history is ennobled by the frequent
appearance of courageous and disinterested patriots,
who have sacrificed their all, that they might help their
country. The bravery of the people has never been
disputed; while, as to the upper classes, the punctilious
honour of a Spanish gentleman has passed into a bye-word,
and circulated through the world. Of the nation
generally, the best observers pronounce them to be
high-minded, generous, truthful, full of integrity, warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
and zealous friends, affectionate in all the private relations
of life, frank, charitable, and humane.<a name="FNanchor_1517_1517" id="FNanchor_1517_1517"></a><a href="#Footnote_1517_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a> Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
sincerity in religious matters is unquestionable;<a name="FNanchor_1518_1518" id="FNanchor_1518_1518"></a><a href="#Footnote_1518_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a> they
are, moreover, eminently temperate and frugal.<a name="FNanchor_1519_1519" id="FNanchor_1519_1519"></a><a href="#Footnote_1519_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a> Yet,
all these great qualities have availed them nothing, and
will avail them nothing, so long as they remain ignorant.
What the end of all this will be, and whether in their
unhappy country the right path will ever be taken, is
impossible for any one to say.<a name="FNanchor_1520_1520" id="FNanchor_1520_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_1520_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a> But if it is not taken,
no amelioration which can possibly be effected will
penetrate below the surface. The sole course is, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
weaken the superstition of the people; and this can
only be done by that march of physical science, which,
familiarizing men with conceptions of order and of regularity,
gradually encroaches on the old notions of perturbation,
of prodigy, and of miracle, and by this means
accustoms the mind to explain the vicissitudes of affairs
by natural considerations, instead of, as heretofore, by
those which are purely supernatural.</p>

<p>To this, in the most advanced countries of Europe,
every thing has been tending for nearly three centuries.
But in Spain, unfortunately, education has always remained,
and still remains, in the hands of the clergy,
who steadily oppose that progress of knowledge, which
they are well aware would be fatal to their own
power.<a name="FNanchor_1521_1521" id="FNanchor_1521_1521"></a><a href="#Footnote_1521_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a> The people, therefore, resting ignorant, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
the causes which kept them in ignorance continuing,
it avails the country nothing, that, from time to time,
enlightened rulers have come forward, and liberal
measures been adopted. The Spanish reformers have,
with rare exceptions, eagerly attacked the Church,
whose authority they clearly saw ought to be diminished.
But what they did not see is, that such diminution can
be of no real use unless it is the result of public opinion
urging on politicians to the work. In Spain, politicians
took the initiative, and the people lagged behind. Hence,
in Spain, what was done at one time was sure to be undone
at another. When the liberals were in power, they
suppressed the Inquisition; but Ferdinand VII. easily
restored it, because, though it had been destroyed by
Spanish legislators, its existence was suited to the
habits and traditions of the Spanish nation.<a name="FNanchor_1522_1522" id="FNanchor_1522_1522"></a><a href="#Footnote_1522_1522" class="fnanchor">[1522]</a> Fresh
changes occurring, this odious tribunal was, in 1820,
again abolished. Still, though its form is gone, its spirit
lives.<a name="FNanchor_1523_1523" id="FNanchor_1523_1523"></a><a href="#Footnote_1523_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a> The name, the body, and the visible appearance
of the Inquisition, are no more; but the spirit which
generated the Inquisition is enshrined in the hearts of
the people, and, on slight provocation, would burst
forth, and reinstate an institution which is the effect,
far more than the cause, of the intolerant bigotry of the
Spanish nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same way, other and more systematic attacks
which were made on the Church, during the present
century, succeeded at first, but were sure to be eventually
baffled.<a name="FNanchor_1524_1524" id="FNanchor_1524_1524"></a><a href="#Footnote_1524_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a> Under Joseph, in 1809, the monastic
orders were suppressed, and their property was confiscated.<a name="FNanchor_1525_1525" id="FNanchor_1525_1525"></a><a href="#Footnote_1525_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a>
Little, however, did Spain gain by this.
The nation was on their side;<a name="FNanchor_1526_1526" id="FNanchor_1526_1526"></a><a href="#Footnote_1526_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a> and as soon as the
storm passed away, they were restored. In 1836, there
was another political movement, and the liberals being
at the head of affairs, Mendizabal secularized all the
Church property, and deprived the clergy of nearly the
whole of their enormous and ill-gotten wealth.<a name="FNanchor_1527_1527" id="FNanchor_1527_1527"></a><a href="#Footnote_1527_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a> He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
did not know how foolish it is to attack an institution,
unless you can first lessen its influence. Overrating the
power of legislation, he underrated the power of opinion.
This, the result clearly showed. Within a very few
years, the reaction began. In 1845, was enacted what
was called the law of devolution, by which the first step
was taken towards the re-endowment of the clergy.<a name="FNanchor_1528_1528" id="FNanchor_1528_1528"></a><a href="#Footnote_1528_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a>
In 1851, their position was still further improved by the
celebrated Concordat, in which the right of acquiring,
as well as of possessing, was solemnly confirmed to
them.<a name="FNanchor_1529_1529" id="FNanchor_1529_1529"></a><a href="#Footnote_1529_1529" class="fnanchor">[1529]</a> With all this, the nation heartily concurred.<a name="FNanchor_1530_1530" id="FNanchor_1530_1530"></a><a href="#Footnote_1530_1530" class="fnanchor">[1530]</a>
Such, however, was the madness of the liberal party,
that, only four years afterwards, when they for a moment
obtained power, they forcibly annulled these arrangements,
and revoked concessions which had been made
to the Church, and which, unhappily for Spain, public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
opinion had ratified.<a name="FNanchor_1531_1531" id="FNanchor_1531_1531"></a><a href="#Footnote_1531_1531" class="fnanchor">[1531]</a> The results might have been
easily foreseen. In Aragon and in other parts of Spain,
the people flew to arms; a Carlist insurrection broke
out, and a cry ran through the country, that religion
was in danger.<a name="FNanchor_1532_1532" id="FNanchor_1532_1532"></a><a href="#Footnote_1532_1532" class="fnanchor">[1532]</a> It is impossible to benefit such a
nation as this. The reformers were, of course, overthrown,
and by the autumn of 1856 their party was
broken up. The political reaction now began, and advanced
so rapidly, that, by the spring of 1857, the policy
of the two preceding years was completely reversed.
Those who idly thought that they could regenerate their
country by laws, saw all their hopes confounded. A
ministry was formed, whose measures were more in
accordance with the national mind. In May 1857,
Cortes assembled. The representatives of the people
sanctioned the proceedings of the executive government,
and, by their united authority, the worst provisions of
the Concordat of 1851 were amply confirmed, the sale
of Church property was forbidden, and all the limitations
which had been set to the power of the bishops
were at once removed.<a name="FNanchor_1533_1533" id="FNanchor_1533_1533"></a><a href="#Footnote_1533_1533" class="fnanchor">[1533]</a></p>

<p>The reader will now be able to understand the real
nature of Spanish civilization. He will see how,
under the high-sounding names of loyalty and religion,
lurk the deadly evils which those names have always
concealed, but which it is the business of the historian
to drag to light and expose. A blind spirit of
reverence, taking the form of an unworthy and ignominious
submission to the Crown and the Church, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
capital and essential vice of the Spanish people. It is
their sole national vice, and it has sufficed to ruin
them. From it all nations have grievously suffered,
and many still suffer. But nowhere in Europe, has this
principle been so long supreme as in Spain. Therefore,
nowhere else in Europe are the consequences so
manifest and so fatal. The idea of liberty is extinct,
if, indeed, in the true sense of the word, it ever can be
said to have existed. Outbreaks, no doubt, there have
been, and will be; but they are bursts of lawlessness,
rather than of liberty. In the most civilized countries,
the tendency always is, to obey even unjust laws, but
while obeying them, to insist on their repeal. This is
because we perceive that it is better to remove
grievances than to resist them. While we submit to
the particular hardship, we assail the system from
which the hardship flows. For a nation to take this
view, requires a certain reach of mind, which, in the
darker periods of European history, was unattainable.
Hence we find, that, in the middle ages, though
tumults were incessant, rebellions were rare. But,
since the sixteenth century, local insurrections, provoked
by immediate injustice, are diminishing, and are
being superseded by revolutions, which strike at once
at the source from whence the injustice proceeds.
There can be no doubt that this change is beneficial;
partly because it is always good to rise from effects to
causes, and partly because revolutions being less frequent
than insurrections, the peace of society would be
more rarely disturbed, if men confined themselves
entirely to the larger remedy. At the same time, insurrections
are generally wrong; revolutions are
always right. An insurrection is too often the mad
and passionate effort of ignorant persons, who are impatient
under some immediate injury, and never stop
to investigate its remote and general causes. But a
revolution, when it is the work of the nation itself, is
a splendid and imposing spectacle, because to the
moral quality of indignation produced by the presence
of evil, it adds the intellectual qualities of foresight
and combination; and, uniting in the same act some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
the highest properties of our nature, it achieves a
double purpose, not only punishing the oppressor, but
also relieving the oppressed.</p>

<p>In Spain, however, there never has been a revolution,
properly so called; there never has even been one
grand national rebellion. The people, though often
lawless, are never free. Among them, we find still
preserved that peculiar taint of barbarism, which makes
men prefer occasional disobedience to systematic
liberty. Certain feelings there are of our common
nature, which even their slavish loyalty cannot eradicate,
and which, from time to time, urge them to resist
injustice. Such instincts are happily the inalienable
lot of humanity, which we cannot forfeit, if we would,
and which are too often the last resource against the
extravagances of tyranny. And this is all that Spain
now possesses. The Spaniards, therefore, resist, not
because they are Spaniards, but because they are men.
Still, even while they resist, they revere. While they
will rise up against a vexatious impost, they crouch
before a system, of which the impost is the smallest
evil. They smite the tax-gatherer, but fall prostrate at
the feet of the contemptible prince for whom the tax-gatherer
plies his craft. They will even revile the
troublesome and importunate monk, or sometimes they
will scoff at the sleek and arrogant priest; while such
is their infatuation, that they would risk their lives in
defence of that cruel Church, which has inflicted on
them hideous calamities, but to which they still cling,
as if it were the dearest object of their affections.</p>

<p>Connected with these habits of mind, and in sooth
forming part of them, we find a reverence for antiquity,
and an inordinate tenacity of old opinions, old beliefs,
and old habits, which remind us of those tropical
civilizations which formerly flourished. Such prejudices
were once universal even in Europe; but they
began to die out in the sixteenth century, and are
now, comparatively speaking, extinct, except in Spain,
where they have always been welcomed. In that
country, they retain their original force, and produce
their natural results. By encouraging the notion, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
all the truths most important to know are already
known, they repress those aspirations, and dull that
generous confidence in the future, without which
nothing really great can be achieved. A people who
regard the past with too wistful an eye, will never
bestir themselves to help the onward progress; they
will hardly believe that progress is possible. To them,
antiquity is synonymous with wisdom, and every improvement
is a dangerous innovation. In this state,
Europe lingered for many centuries; in this state,
Spain still lingers. Hence the Spaniards are remarkable
for an inertness, a want of buoyancy, and an
absence of hope, which, in our busy and enterprizing
age, isolate them from the rest of the civilized world.
Believing that little can be done, they are in no hurry
to do it. Believing that the knowledge they have
inherited, is far greater than any they can obtain, they
wish to preserve their intellectual possessions whole
and unimpaired; inasmuch as the least alteration in
them might lessen their value. Content with what
has been already bequeathed, they are excluded from
that great European movement, which, first clearly
perceptible in the sixteenth century, has ever since
been steadily advancing, unsettling old opinions,
destroying old follies, reforming and improving on
every side, influencing even such barbarous countries
as Russia and Turkey; but leaving Spain unscathed.
While the human intellect has been making the most
prodigious and unheard-of strides, while discoveries in
every quarter are simultaneously pressing upon us, and
coming in such rapid and bewildering succession, that
the strongest sight, dazzled by the glare of their
splendour, is unable to contemplate them as a whole;
while other discoveries still more important, and still
more remote from ordinary experience, are manifestly
approaching, and may be seen looming in the distance,
whence they are now obscurely working on the advanced
thinkers who are nearest to them, filling their
minds with those ill-defined, restless, and almost
uneasy, feelings, which are the invariable harbingers
of future triumph; while the veil is being rudely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
torn, and nature, violated at all points, is forced to disclose
her secrets, and reveal her structure, her economy,
and her laws, to the indomitable energy of man; while
Europe is ringing with the noise of intellectual achievements,
with which even despotic governments affect to
sympathize, in order that they may divert them from
their natural course, and use them as new instruments
whereby to oppress yet more the liberties of the
people; while, amidst this general din and excitement,
the public mind, swayed to and fro, is tossed and
agitated,&mdash;Spain sleeps on, untroubled, unheeding,
impassive, receiving no impressions from the rest of
the world, and making no impressions upon it. There
she lies, at the further extremity of the Continent, a
huge and torpid mass, the sole representative now remaining
of the feelings and knowledge of the Middle
Ages. And, what is the worst symptom of all, she is
satisfied with her own condition. Though she is the
most backward country in Europe, she believes herself
to be the foremost. She is proud of every thing of
which she should be ashamed. She is proud of the
antiquity of her opinions; proud of her orthodoxy;
proud of the strength of her faith; proud of her
immeasurable and childish credulity; proud of her
unwillingness to amend either her creed or her
customs; proud of her hatred of heretics, and proud of
the undying vigilance with which she has baffled their
efforts to obtain a full and legal establishment on her
soil.</p>

<p>All these things conspiring together, produce, in
their aggregate, that melancholy exhibition to which
we give the collective name of Spain. The history
of that single word is the history of nearly every
vicissitude of which the human species is capable. It
comprises the extremes of strength and of weakness,
of unbounded wealth and of abject poverty. It is the
history of the mixture of different races, languages,
and bloods. It includes almost every political combination
which the wit of man can devise; laws infinite
in variety, as well as in number; constitutions of all
kinds, from the most stringent to the most liberal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
Democracy, monarchy, government by priests, government
by municipalities, government by nobles, government
by representative bodies, government by natives,
government by foreigners, have been tried, and tried
in vain. Material appliances have been lavishly used;
arts, inventions, and machines introduced from abroad,
manufactures set up, communications opened, roads
made, canals dug, mines worked, harbours formed.
In a word, there has been every sort of alteration,
except alterations of opinion; there has been every
possible change, except changes in knowledge. And
the result is, that in spite of the efforts of successive
governments, in spite of the influence of foreign customs,
and in spite of those physical ameliorations, which
just touch the surface of society, but are unable
to penetrate beneath, there are no signs of national
progress; the priests are rather gaining ground than
losing it; the slightest attack on the Church rouses the
people; while, even the dissoluteness of the clergy,
and the odious vices which, in the present century,
have stained the throne, can do naught to lessen either
the superstition or the loyalty which the accumulated
force of many centuries has graven on the minds, and
eaten into the hearts of the Spanish nation.</p>

coast of the province of Alicante, where their effects have been very
disastrous. Much further in the interior, in the small Sierra del
Tremédal, or district of Albarracia, in the province of Terruel,
eruptions and shocks have been very frequent since the most remote
periods; the black porphyry is there seen traversing the altered strata
of the oolitic formation. The old inhabitants of the country speak of
sinking of the ground and of the escape of sulphureous gases when they
were young; these same phenomena have occurred during four consecutive
months of the preceding winter, accompanied by earthquakes, which have
caused considerable mischief to the buildings of seven villages situated
within a radius of two leagues. They have not, however, been attended
with any loss of life, on account of the inhabitants hastening to
abandon their dwellings at the first indications of danger.&rsquo; <i>Ezquerra

Society of London</i>, vol. vi. pp. 412, 413, London, 1850. &lsquo;The provinces

great earthquakes.&rsquo; <i>Lyell's Principles of Geology</i>, London, 1853, p.
358. &lsquo;Los terremotos son tan sensibles y freqüentes en lo alto de las

configuration, with its vast tableland of the two Castiles, rising
nearly 2,000 feet above the sea, is perhaps the most interesting portion
of Europe, not only in this respect, but as a region of earthquake
disturbance, where the energy and destroying power of this agency have
been more than once displayed upon the most tremendous scale.&rsquo; <i>Mallet's
Earthquake Catalogue of the British Association</i>, Report for 1858, p. 9,
London, 1858.</p>

<p>I quote these passages at length, partly on account of their interest as
physical truths, and partly because the facts stated in them are
essential for a right understanding of the history of Spain. Their
influence on the Spanish character was pointed out, for I believe the
first time, in my <i>History of Civilization</i>, vol. i. pp. 123, 124. On
that occasion, I adduced no evidence to prove the frequency of
earthquakes in the Peninsula, because I supposed that all persons
moderately acquainted with the physical history of the earth were aware
of the circumstance. But, in April 1858, a criticism of my book appeared
in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, in which the serious blunders which I am said
to have committed are unsparingly exposed. In p. 468 of that Review, the
critic, after warning his readers against my &lsquo;inaccuracies,&rsquo; observes,
&lsquo;But Mr. Buckle goes on to state that &ldquo;earthquakes and volcanic
eruptions are more frequent and more destructive in Italy, and in the
Spanish and Portuguese peninsula, than in any other of the great
countries.&rdquo; Whence he infers, by a singular process of reasoning, that
superstition is more rife, and the clergy more powerful; but that the
fine arts flourish, poetry is cultivated, and the sciences neglected.
Every link in this chain is more or less faulty. There is no volcano in
the Spanish peninsula, and the only earthquake known to have occurred
there was that of Lisbon.&rsquo; Now, I have certainly no right to expect that
a reviewer, composing a popular article for an immediate purpose, and
knowing that when his article is read, it will be thrown aside and
forgotten, should, under such unfavourable circumstances, be at the
pains of mastering all the details of his subject. To look for this
would be the height of injustice. He has no interest in being accurate;
his name being concealed, his reputation, if he have any, is not at
stake; and the errors into which he falls ought to be regarded with
leniency, inasmuch as their vehicle being an ephemeral publication, they
are not likely to be remembered, and they are therefore not likely to
work much mischief.</p>

<p>These considerations have always prevented me from offering any reply to
anonymous criticisms. But the passage in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, to
which I have called attention, displays such marvellous ignorance, that
I wish to rescue it from oblivion, and to put it on record as a literary
curiosity. The other charges brought against me could, I need hardly
say, be refuted with equal ease. Indeed, no reasonable person can
possibly suppose that, after years of arduous and uninterrupted study, I
should have committed those childish blunders with which my opponents
unscrupulously taunt me. Once for all, I may say that I have made no
assertion for the truth of which I do not possess ample and irrefragable
evidence. But it is impossible for me to arrange and adduce all the
proofs at the same time; and, in so vast an enterprise, I must in some
degree rely, not on the generosity of the reader, but on his candour. I
do not think that I am asking too much in requesting him, if on any
future occasion his judgment should be in suspense between me and my
critics, to give me the benefit of the doubt, and to bear in mind that
statements embodied in a deliberate and slowly-concocted work,
authenticated by the author's name, are, as a mere matter of antecedent
probability, more likely to be accurate than statements made in reviews
and newspapers, which, besides being written hastily, and often at very
short notice, are unsigned, and by which, consequently, their
promulgators evade all responsibility, avoid all risk, and can, in their
own persons, neither gain fame nor incur obloquy.</p>

<p>The simple fact is, that in Spain there have been more earthquakes than
in all other parts of Europe put together, Italy excepted. If the
destruction of property and of life produced by this one cause were
summed up, the results would be appalling. When we moreover add those
alarming shocks, which, though less destructive, are far more frequent,
and of which not scores, nor hundreds, but thousands have occurred, and
which by increasing the total amount of fear, have to an incalculable
extent promoted the growth of superstition, it is evident that such
phenomena must have played an important part in
forming the national character of the Spaniards. Whoever will take the
trouble of consulting the following passages will find decisive proofs
of the frightful ravages committed by earthquakes in Spain alone;
Portugal being excluded. They all refer to a period of less than two
hundred years; the first being in 1639, and the last in 1829. <i>Lettres
de Madame de Villars, Ambassadrice en Espagne</i>, Amsterdam, 1759, p. 205.
<i>Laborde's Spain</i>, London, 1809, vol. i. p. 169. <i>Dunlop's Memoirs of
Spain</i>, Edinburgh, 1834, vol. ii. pp. 226, 227. <i>Boisel</i>, <i>Journal du
Voyage d'Espagne</i>, Paris, 1669, 4to, p. 243. <i>Mallet's Earthquake
Catalogue of the British Association</i>, London, 1858; Report for 1853, p.
146; for 1854, pp. 26, 27, 54, 55, 57, 58, 65, 110, 140, 173, 196, 202.
<i>Swinburne's Travels through Spain</i>, London, 1787, vol. i. p. 166.
<i>Ford's Spain</i>, London, 1847, p. 178. <i>Bacon's Six Years in Biscay</i>,
London, 1838, p. 32, compared with <i>Inglis' Spain</i>, London, 1831, vol.
i. p. 393, vol. ii. p. 289&ndash;291.</p>

<p>These authorities narrate the ravages committed during a hundred and
ninety years. From their account it is manifest, that in Spain hardly a
generation passed by without castles, villages, and towns being
destroyed, and men, women, or children killed by earthquakes. But
according to our anonymous instructor, it is doubtful if there ever was
an earthquake in Spain; for he says of the whole Peninsula, including
Portugal, &lsquo;the only earthquake known to have occurred there was that of
Lisbon.&rsquo;</p></div>

see a good passage in <i>Conde</i>, <i> Historia de la Dominacion de los
Arabes</i>, p. 155. &lsquo;En el año 267, dia jeuves, 22 de la luna de Xawâl,
tembló la tierra con tan espantoso ruido y estremecimiento, que cayeron
muchos alcazares y magnificos edificios, y otros quedaron muy
quebrantados, se hundieron montes, se abrieron peñascos, y la tierra se
hundió y tragó pueblos y alturas, el mar se retrajo y apartó de las
costas, y desaparecieron islas y escollos en el mar. Las gentes
abandonaban los pueblos y huian á los campos,
las aves salian de sus nidos, y las fieras
espantadas dejaban sus grutas y madrigueras con general turbacion y
trastorno; nunca los hombres vieron ni oyeron cosa semejante; se
arruinaron muchos pueblos de la costa meridional y occidental de España.
Todas estas cosas influyeron tanto en los animos de los hombres, y en
especial en la ignorante multitud, que no pudo Almondhir persuadirles
que eran cosas naturales, aunque poco frecüentes, que no tenían influjo
ni relacion con las obras de los hombres, ni con sus
empresas, sino por su ignorancia y vanos temores, que lo mismo temblaba
la tierra para los muslimes que para los cristianos, para las fieras que
para las inocentes criaturas.&rsquo; Compare <i>Geddes' Tracts concerning
Spain</i>, London, 1730, vol. i. p. 89; and Mariana, who, under the year
1395, says (<i>Historia de España</i>, vol. v. p. 27): &lsquo;Tembló la tierra en
Valencia mediado el mes de Diciembre, con que muchos edificios cayéron
por tierra, otros quedaron desplomados; que era maravilla y lástima. El
pueblo, <i>como agorero que es, pensaba eran señales del cielo</i> y
pronosticos de los daños que temian.&rsquo; The
history of Spain abounds with similar instances far too numerous to
quote or even to refer to. But the subject is so important and has been
so misrepresented, that, even at the risk of wearying the reader, I will
give one more illustration of the use of earthquakes in fostering
Spanish superstition. In 1504 &lsquo;an earthquake, accompanied by a
tremendous hurricane, such as the oldest men did not remember, had
visited Andalusia, and especially Carmona, a place belonging to the
Queen, and occasioned frightful desolation there.&rsquo; The superstitious
Spaniards now read in these portents <i>the prophetic signs by which
Heaven announces some great calamity. Prayers were put up in every
temple,</i> &amp;c. &amp;c. <i>Prescott's History of Ferdinand and Isabella</i>, Paris,
1842, vol. iii. p. 174.</p></div>

habits of the Spanish peasantry,&rsquo; noticed in <i>Cook's Spain</i>, vol. i. p.
85, where, however, the connexion between this and the physical
constitution of the country is not indicated. The solution is given by
Mr. Ticknor with his usual accuracy and penetration: &lsquo;The climate and
condition of the Peninsula, which from a very remote period had favoured
the shepherd's life and his pursuits, facilitated, no doubt, if they did
not occasion, the first introduction into Spanish poetry of a pastoral
tone, whose echoes are heard far back among the old ballads.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;From
the Middle Ages the occupations of a shepherd's life had prevailed in
Spain and Portugal to a greater extent than elsewhere in Europe; and,
probably, in consequence of this circumstance, eclogues and bucolics
were early known in the poetry of both countries, and became connected
in both with the origin of the popular drama.&rsquo; <i>Ticknor's History of
Spanish Literature</i>, London, 1849, vol. iii. pp. 9, 36. On the pastoral
literature of Spain, see <i>Bouterwek's History of Spanish Literature</i>,

romances, <i>Southey's Letters from Spain</i>, Bristol, 1799, p. 336. But
these writers, not seizing the whole question, have failed to observe
the relation between the literary, physical, and social phenomena.</p></div>

seemed resolved to turn Spain into a desert; ravaging each other's
fields, and destroying every crop they could meet with. <i>Conde</i>,

havoc, which was continued with few interruptions for about seven
hundred years, has done much towards forming the national character of
the Spaniards, it may be worth while to refer to <i>Mariana</i>, <i>Historia de

appears from the different statements of various writers respecting the
duration of Arianism, a point of much more importance than the death and
accession of kings. Antequera (<i>Historia de la Legislacion Española</i>,
Madrid, 1849, p. 37) says, &lsquo;La secta Arriana, pues, segun las epocas
fijadas, permaneció en España 125 años;&rsquo; Fleury (<i>Histoire

and M'Crie, generally well informed, says in his <i>History of the
Reformation in Spain</i>, Edinburgh, 1829, p. 7, &lsquo;Arianism was the
prevailing and established creed of the country for nearly two
centuries:&rsquo; for this, he refers to Gregory of Tours. With good reason,

forgets his patriotism, and warmly praises the ferocious barbarian who
made war, indeed, on his country, but still whose speculative opinions
were supposed to be sound. &lsquo;Mientras Alarico desfogaba su encono contra

Descubrió desde alli los cuerpos de los Santos martirizados en los

no quedase reliquia. Cumplióse luego la órden: pero aquel impio probó
bien presto los rigores de la venganza divina que volvía por la sangre
derramada de sus Santos. Improvisamente se le pegó la lengua al paladar
y fauces; cerrósele la boca, y no pudo pronunciar una palabra, ni dar un

expresses his approbation in the following terms: &lsquo;Arrancado de nuestra
peninsula el imperio Mahometano, quedaba todavía la secta Judayca, peste
acaso mas perniciosa, y sin duda mas peligrosa y extendida, por estar
los Judíos establecidos en todos los pueblos de ella. Pero los Catolicos

dominios los Judíos que no se bautizasen dentro de 4 meses.&rsquo; <i>Ortiz</i>,

these and similar events are judged by Spaniards, induces me to give
their own words at a length which otherwise would be needlessly prolix.
Historians, generally, are too apt to pay more attention to public
transactions than to the opinions which those transactions evoke;
though, in point of fact, the opinions form the most valuable part of
history, since they are the result of more general causes, while
political actions are often due to the peculiarities of powerful
individuals.</p>

codicil, in which he &lsquo;enjoined upon his son to follow up and bring to
justice every heretic in his dominions, and this without exception, and
without favour or mercy to any one. He conjured Philip to cherish the
holy inquisition as the best means of accomplishing this good work.&rsquo;
<i>Prescott's Additions to Robertson's Charles V.</i>, p. 576. See also his
instructions to Philip in <i>Raumer's History of the Sixteenth and

Inquisition, see his conversation with Sir Thomas Wyatt, printed from
the State Papers in <i>Froude's History of England</i>, vol. iii. p. 456,
London, 1858. This may have been mere declamation; but in <i>Tapia's
Civilizacion Española</i>, Madrid, 1840, vol. iii. pp. 76, 77, will be
found a deliberate and official letter, in which Charles does not
hesitate to say, &lsquo;La santa inquisicion como oficio santo y puesto por
los reyes católicos, nuestros señores y abuelos á honra de Dios nuestro
señor y de nuestra santa fé católica, tengo firme é entrañablemente
asentado y fijado en mi corazon, para la mandar favorecer y honrar, como

one, is perfectly Spanish: &lsquo;Su testamento y codicilo respiran las ideas

but, on the other hand, Raumer, in his valuable <i>History of the
Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries</i>, vol. i. p. 22, justly observes,
that his character has been misrepresented &lsquo;by reason that historians
have availed themselves by preference of the inimical narratives of
French and Protestant writers.&rsquo; To steer between these extremes, I will
transcribe the summing up of Charles's reign as it is given by a learned
and singularly unprejudiced writer. &lsquo;Tortuous as was sometimes the
policy of the emperor, he never, like Francis, acted with treachery; his
mind had too much of native grandeur for such baseness. Sincere in
religion and friendship, faithful to his word, clement beyond example,
liberal towards his servants, indefatigable in his regal duties, anxious
for the welfare of his subjects, and generally blameless in private
life, his character will not suffer by a comparison with that of any
monarch of his times.&rsquo; <i>Dunham's History of Spain</i>, vol. v. p. 41.
&lsquo;Clemency was the basis of his character.&rsquo; p. 30.</p></div>

that the royal widows &lsquo;seront obligées à prendre l'habit de religieuses,
et à s'enfermer dans un monastère pour le reste de leur vie.&rsquo; <i>Fleury</i>,
<i>Histoire Ecclésiastique</i>, vol. ix. p. 104. In 1065 Ferdinand I. died;
and, says the biographer of the Spanish Queens, &lsquo;La Reyna sobrevivió: y

expressamos no tanto por <i>la costumbre antigua</i>, quanto por constar en

Reynas Catholicas</i>, Madrid, 1761, 4to, vol. i. p. 148. In 1667 it was a
settled principle that &lsquo;les reines d'Espagne n'en sortent point. Le

consists for the most part of documents previously unpublished, many of
which are taken from the archives at Simancas. To the critical
historian, it would have been more useful if the original Spanish had

History of Spanish Literature</i>, vol. iii. pp. 213, 214, which might
easily be corroborated by other testimony; as, for instance, Lafuente
under the year 1710: &lsquo;Ni el abandono de la Francia, ni la prolongacion y
los azares de la guerra, ni los sacrificios pecuniarios y personales de
tantos años, nada bastaba á entibiar el amor de los castellanos á su rey

(<i>Mémoires</i>, vol. ii. p. 114, edit. Paris, 1778): &lsquo;La fidélité inouie

1827. All these passages illustrate Spanish loyalty in the eighteenth
century, except the reference to Gramont, which concerns the
seventeenth, and which should be compared with the following
observations of Madame D'Aulnoy, who writes from Madrid in 1679:
&lsquo;Quelques richesses qu'ayent les grands Seigneurs, quelque grande que
soit leur fierté ou leur présomption, ils obéïssent aux moindres ordres
du Roy, avec une exactitude et un respect que l'on ne peut assez loüer.
Sur le premier ordre ils partent, ils reviennent, ils vont en prison, ou
en exil, sans se plaindre. Il ne se peut trouver une soûmission, et une
obéïssance plus parfaite, ni un amour plus sincère, que celui des
Espagnols pour leur Roi. Ce nom leur est sacré, et pour réduire le
peuple à tout ce que l'on souhaite, il suffit de dire, &ldquo;Le Roi le
veut.&rdquo;&rsquo; <i>D'Aulnoy</i>, <i>Voyage</i>, vol. ii. pp. 256, 257.</p></div>

religion of loyalty, in an earlier period, see <i>Florez</i>, <i>Reynas

invincible. Fontenay-Mareuil, who visited Spain in 1612, and was not a
little proud of the achievement, says, &lsquo;Au reste, parcequ'on ne va pas

qu'estant comme en un coin, et séparée du reste du monde par la mer ou

worth quoting, and which contain a curious mixture of truth and error:
&lsquo;Comment la monarchie espagnole fut-elle déchue de tant de grandeur et
de gloire? Comment perdit-elle les Pays-Bas et le Portugal dans le
dix-septième siècle, et s'y trouva-t-elle réduite à n'être qu'un
squelette de ce qu'elle avait été auparavant? Comment vit-elle
disparaître plus d'une moitié de sa population? Comment, possédant les
mines inépuisables du Nouveau Monde, les revenus de l'état n'étaient à
peine que de six millions de ducats sous le règne de Philippe III?
Comment son agriculture et son industrie furent-elles ruinées? et
comment presque tout son commerce passa-t-il dans les mains de ses plus
grands ennemis? Ce n'est point ici le lieu d'examiner les véritables
causes d'une métamorphose si triste; il suffira d'indiquer <i>que tous les
grands empires contiennent en euxmêmes le germe de leur dissolution</i>,&rsquo;
&amp;c. &lsquo;D'ailleurs les successeurs de ces deux monarques&rsquo; (Charles V. and
Philip II.) &lsquo;n'eurent point les mêmes talens, ni les ducs de Lerme et
d'Olivarès, leurs ministres, ceux du cardinal Cisneros; et il est
difficile de calculer l'influence de la bonne ou de la mauvaise
direction des affaires sur la prospérité ou les malheurs des nations.
Sous une même forme de gouvernement, quel qu'il puisse être, <i>elles
tombent ou se relèvent suivant la capacité des hommes qui les dirigent</i>,
et d'après les circonstances où ils agissent.&rsquo; <i>Sempère</i>, <i>Histoire des
Cortès</i>, Bordeaux, 1815, pp. 265&ndash;267. Of the two passages which I have
marked with italics, the first is a clumsy, though common, attempt to
explain complicated phenomena by a metaphor which saves the trouble of
generalizing their laws. The other passage, though perfectly true as
regards Spain, does not admit of that universal application which M.
Sempere supposes; inasmuch as in England, and in the United States of
America, national prosperity has steadily advanced, even when the rulers
have been very incapable men.</p></div>

from that period declined with fearful rapidity.&rsquo; <i>Dunham's History of
Spain</i>, vol. v. p. 87. And Ortiz (<i>Compendio</i>, vol. vii., Prologo, p. 6)
classes together &lsquo;la muerte de Felipe II. y principios de nuestra
decadencia.&rsquo; The same judicious historian elsewhere observes (vol. vi.
p. 211), that if Philip III. had been equal to his father, Spain would
have continued to flourish. Several of the more recent Spanish writers,
looking at the heavy expenses caused by the policy of Philip II., and at
the debts which he incurred, have supposed that the decline of the
country began in the latter years of his reign. But the truth is, that
no great nation ever was, or ever will be, ruined by the prodigality of
its government. Such extravagance causes general discomfort, and
therefore ought not to be tolerated; but if this were the place for so
long an argument, I could easily show that its other and more permanent
inconveniences are nothing like what they are commonly supposed to be.</p></div>

digest it, he voids it in the same manner.&rsquo; <i>Mahon's Spain under Charles

following passage in Davila's Life of Philip III. The remarks apply to
Philip II. &lsquo;Que solo havia gobernado sin Validos ni Privados, tomando
para sí solo, como primera causa de su gobierno, el mandar, prohibir,
premiar, castigar, hacer mercedes, conocer sugetos, elegir Ministros, dar
oficios, y tener como espiritu que andaba sobre las aguas, ciencia y
providencia de todo, para que nada se hiciese sin su saber y querer: no

Señor mandaba, velando sobre cada uno, como pastor de sus ovejas, para

the ecclesiastical hierarchy, though he was completely subjugated by

religious order, already far too powerful, he was careful that it should
never gain such a height as would enable it to overtop the royal
authority.&rsquo; <i>Prescott's History of Philip II.</i>, vol. iii. p. 235. &lsquo;Pero

&lsquo;Porque no era fácil imaginar entónces, ni por fortuna se ha repetido el
ejemplo después, que hubiera un monarca tan pródigo de autoridad, y al

firmar los documentos de Estado, quisiera dar á la firma de un vasalla
suyo la misma autoridad que á la suya propia, y que advirtiera y
ordenára, como ordenó Felipe III. á todos sus consejos, tribunales, y

Madrid trasladó á las Agustinas Recoletas de Santa Isabel desde la calle
del Principe al sitio en que hoy estan. Protegió con sus limosnas la
fundacion de la Iglesia de Carmelitas Descalzas de Santa Ana; y empezó á
fundar el Real Convento de las Agustinas Recoletas con titulo de la

Good, was the golden age of Churchmen. Though religious foundations were
already too numerous, great additions were made to them; and in those
which already existed, new altars or chancels were erected. Thus, the
duke of Lerma founded seven monasteries and two collegiate churches;
thus, also, the diocese of Calahorra numbered 18,000 chaplains, Seville
14,000. How uselessly the ministers of religion were multiplied, will
appear still more clearly from the fact that the cathedral of Seville
alone had a hundred, when half-a-dozen would assuredly have been
sufficient for the public offices of devotion.&rsquo; <i>Dunham's History of
Spain</i>, vol. v. p. 274. According to the passage quoted in note 93, from
Davila, there were twenty-four thousand &lsquo;clerigos&rsquo; in the two dioceses
of Calahorra and Pamplona.</p></div>

prodigiosamente el poder y la autoridad de la Iglesia. Sus pingües
riquezas desmembraban de una manera considerable las rentas de la
corona; y el estado eclesiástico, que muchos abrazaron en un principio á
consecuencia de las desgracias y calamidades de la época, fué despues el
mas solicitado por las inmensas ventajas que ofrecia su condicion
comparada con la de las clases restantes.&rsquo; <i>Antequera</i>, <i>Historia de la

statement made by the University of Toledo in 1619, or 1620, that &lsquo;hay
doblados religiosos, clerigos y estudiantes; porque ya <i>no hallan otro
modo de vivir</i>, <i>ni de poder sustentarse</i>.&rsquo; If the eye of M. Lafuente
had lighted upon this and other passages, which I shall shortly quote
from contemporary observers, he would, I think, have expressed himself
much more strongly than he has done respecting this period, in his
recent brilliant, but unsatisfactory, History of Spain. On the great
wealth of the convents in 1679, when the rest of the country was steeped
in poverty, see a letter dated Madrid, July 25, 1679, in <i>D'Aulnoy</i>,
<i>Relation du Voyage d'Espagne</i>, Lyon, 1693, vol. ii. p. 251. But the
earliest evidence I have met with is in a letter, written in 1609, to
Prince Henry of England, by Sir Charles Cornwallis, the English
ambassador at Madrid. &lsquo;The furniture of their churches here, and the
riches and lustre of their sepulchres made in every monasterie (the
general povertye of this kingdome considered), are almost incredible.
The laity of this nation may say with Davyde (though in another sense),
&ldquo;Zelus domus tuæ comedit me:&rdquo; for, assuredly, the riches of the
Temporall hath in a manner all fallen into the mouthes and devouring
throates of the Spiritual.&rsquo; <i>Winwood's Memorials of Affairs of State</i>,

seventy years ago, and which, at the time of its appearance, made
considerable noise, this peculiarity is frankly admitted, but is deemed
rather an honour to Spain than otherwise, inasmuch as that country, we
are told, has produced philosophers who have gone much deeper into
things than Bacon, Descartes, and Newton, who, no doubt, were clever
men, but were nowise comparable to the great thinkers of the
Peninsula. Such assertions, proceeding, not from some ignorant despiser
of physical science, who contemns what he has never been at the pains to
study, but from a really able and, in some respects, competent judge,
are important for the history of opinion; and as the book is not very
common, I will give two or three extracts. &lsquo;Confiesan los Franceses con
ingenuidad que Descartes fué un novelista: y con todo eso quieren
hacerle pasar por el promotor de la filosofía en Europa, como si su
filosofía se desemejase mucho de la que dominaba en las sectas de la
antigüedad. Su tratádo &ldquo;Del Metodo&rdquo; es nada en comparacion de los libros
&ldquo;De la Corrupcion de las Artes&rdquo; de Juan Luis Vives, que le antecedió
buen número de años.&rsquo; <i>Oracion Apologética por la España y su Mérito
Literario por D. J. P. Forner</i>, Madrid, 1786, p. xi. &lsquo;No hemos tenido en
los efectos un Cartesio, no un Neuton: démoslo de barato: pero hemos
tenido justísimos legisladores y excelentes filósofos prácticos, que han
preferido el inefable gusto de trabajar en beneficio de la humanidad á
la ociosa ocupacion de edificar mundos imaginarios en la soledad y
silencio de un gabinete.&rsquo; p. 12. &lsquo;Nada se disputaba en España.&rsquo; p. 61.
At p. 143 a comparison between Bacon and Vives; and the final decision,
p. 146, that Vives enjoys &lsquo;una gloriosa superioridad sobre todos los
sabios de todos los siglos.&rsquo;</p></div>

to wear the clothes in 1613. &lsquo;Tal era su situacion el sábado santo 2 de

incorporó tambien Cervantes, como lo hizo Lope de Vega, en la

that may well be called enormous.&rsquo; <i>Ticknor's History of Spanish

depicted in <i>Prescott's History of Philip III.</i>, vol. iii. pp. 148&ndash;151.
The splendid courage of the Moriscoes is attested by Mendoza in his
contemporary history of the war; but, in narrating the horrible outrages
which they undoubtedly committed, he makes no allowance for the
long-continued and insufferable provocations which they had received
from the Spanish Christians. What he mentions of one of the battles is
curious, and I do not remember to have seen it elsewhere recorded. &lsquo;Fue
porfiado por ambas partes el combate hasta venir á las espadas, de que
los Moros se aprovechan menos que nosotros, por tener las suyas un filo
i no herir ellos de punta.&rsquo; <i>Mendoza</i>, <i>Guerra de Granada</i>, edit. 4to.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1294_1294" id="Footnote_1294_1294"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1294_1294"><span class="label">[1294]</span></a> An instance of this was exhibited in 1578, on the very
day in which Philip III. was born. &lsquo;Predicando en un lugar de Aragon,
todo de Moriscos, llamado Ricla, ó Torrellas, un religioso, llamado
Vargas, el mismo dia que nació su Magestad, viendo el poco fruto que
hacia con sus sermones, dixo, como en Profecia, á aquella gente rebelde:
Pues no quereis despedir de vuestros pechos esta infernal secta, sabed,
que ha nacido en Castilla vn Principe que os ha de echar de España.&rsquo; <i>Porreño</i>, <i>Dichos
y Hechos de Phelipe III.</i>, in <i>Yañez</i>, <i>Memorias</i>, Madrid,
1723, p. 224; and nearly the same words in <i>Janer</i>, <i>Condicion de los
Moriscos</i>, p. 60. Mr. Prescott, in his <i>History of Philip II.</i>, vol.
iii. p. 139, quotes a Ms. letter from Don John of Austria to Philip II.,
written in 1570, and stating that the Spanish monks were openly
preaching against the leniency with which the king treated the
Moriscoes. &lsquo;Predicando en los púlpitos publicamente contra la benignidad
y clemencia que V. M. ha mandado usar con esta gente.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1295_1295" id="Footnote_1295_1295"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1295_1295"><span class="label">[1295]</span></a> In a recent work of considerable authority, it is denied
that Philip II. entertained the desire of expelling the Moriscoes. &lsquo;El
carácter austero y la severidad de Felipe II. redundaban en favor de los
moriscos, porque no daba oidos á las instigaciones de algunos personajes
que señalaban la expulsion general como unico remedio
eficaz para los males que ofrecia al pais aquella desventurada raza.
Acababa el monarca de tocar los tristes resultados de una emigracion por
las funestas consecuencias de la despoblacion del reino granadino, y
preferia continuar en la <i>senda de la conciliacion</i>, procurando de nuevo
la enseñanza de los conversos.&rsquo; <i>Janer</i>, <i>Condicion de los Moriscos</i>,
Madrid, 1857, p. 59. But to say nothing of the fact that this is
contrary to all we know of the character of Philip, we have, on the
other side of the question, the testimony of Archbishop Ribera, who
had often communicated with the King on the subject, and who distinctly
states that Philip desired the expulsion of the Moors from Spain, &lsquo;El
hechar los Moros deste Reyno, ha sido cosa muy desseada, y procurada por
los Reyes Predecessores del Rey nuestro Señor, aunque no executada.&rsquo; &hellip;
&lsquo;El Rey Don Felipe Segundo, nuestro Señor, despues de suceder en estos
Reynos, <i>tuvo el mismo desseo</i>; y assi mandó, que se juntassen los
Prelados deste Reyno para buscar remedio el año de 1568; siendo
Arçobispo desta Metropoli el Reverendissimo Don Hernando de Lloazes.
Hizieronse en aquella Junta algunas Constituciones de consideracion.
Visto que no aprovechaban, mandó el año 1587 que se hiziesse otra Junta,
<i>en la qual me hallé yo</i>: añadimos tambien algunas nuevas
Constituciones. Y constando á su Magestad que no eran bastantes las
diligencias passadas, y que siempre perseveraban en su heregia, se
resolvio de mandarlos hechar del Reyno, ó por lo menos meterlos dentro
de la tierra.&rsquo; <i>Ximenez</i>, <i>Vida de Ribera</i>, Roma, 1734, 4to. pp. 419,
420. This important passage is decisive as to the real feelings of
Philip, unless we assume that Ribera has stated a deliberate falsehood.
But, strange to say, even the book in which so remarkable a passage is
contained, appears to be unknown either to M. Janer or to M. Lafuente.</p></div>

believe, extremely rare; at all events, I endeavoured in vain to obtain
a copy from Spain or Italy, and, after some years' unsuccessful search,
I met with the one I now have, on a London book-stall. M. de Circourt,
in his learned History of the Spanish Arabs, does not appear to have
been aware of its existence, and he complains that he could not procure
the works of Ribera, whose Memorials he consequently quotes second-hand.

168, 351. Nor does Watson seem to have known it; though both he and M.
de Circourt refer to Escriva's Life of Ribera. <i>Watson's Philip III.</i>,
London, 1839, pp. 214&ndash;221. An abstract of these Memorials is given by
Geddes, who, though a learned and accurate writer, had the mischievous
habit of not indicating the sources of his information. <i>Geddes'

Bernardo de Roias y Sandoval, Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo, and
Inquisitor-General and Chancellor of Spain. This great prelate, who was
brother to the Duke of Lerma, by whom the king for some years before,
and for some years after the expulsion was absolutely governed, was so
zealous to have the whole race of the Moriscoes extinguished, that he
opposed the detaining of their children who were under seven years of
age, affirming that of the two he judged it more advisable to cut the
throats of all the Moriscoes, men, women, and children, than to have any
of their children left in Spain, to defile the true Spanish blood with a
mixture of the Moorish.&rsquo; <i>Geddes' Tracts</i>, vol. i. pp. 85, 86. Navarrete
has pronounced a glowing eulogy upon the piety and other noble qualities
of this prelate; and says that &lsquo;llenando de esplendor con su virtud tres
sillas episcopales, mereció que Clemente VIII. le honrase con el capelo,
y fué elevado á la primada de Toledo y al empleo de inquisidor general.&rsquo;

the king should give the word, they might, without any scruple of
conscience, cut the throats of all the Moriscoes, and not spare any of
them upon their professing themselves Christians; but to follow the holy
and laudable example of the Croisado that was raised against the
Albigenses, who, upon their having made themselves masters of the city
of Bezeir; wherein were two hundred thousand Catholics and hereticks,
did ask Father Arnold, a Cistercian monk, who was their chief preacher,
&ldquo;Whether they should put any to the sword that pretended to be
Catholics;&rdquo; and were answered by the holy Abbot, &ldquo;That they should kill
all without distinction, and leave it to God, who knew his own, to
reward them for being true Catholics in the next world;&rdquo; which was
accordingly executed.&rsquo; <i>Geddes</i>, vol. i. p. 84.</p></div>

weakness on the part of Philip, was a strictly logical application of
the principles which he entertained, and which, indeed, were almost
universal in Spain. We know from his contemporary biographer, that

por dos Prophetas suyos. <i>Todo (digo otra vez) nos sobrará.</i>&rsquo; All this
was to happen to the people; while, as to the king, he, in the same
sermon, p. 416, is likened to David; and it was declared by another high
authority, that his expulsion of the Moriscoes was so great an exploit
(&lsquo;hazaña&rsquo;), that &lsquo;durára su memoria por los venideros siglos.&rsquo;

Tercero</i>, lib. ii. cap. 41, p. 139) pronounces it to be the most
glorious achievement which had been seen since the days of Pelayo. All
this is natural enough; but what is really curious is, to trace the
modern remains of this feeling. Campomanes (<i>Apendice á la Educacion
Popular</i>, vol. iv. p. 130, Madrid, 1777), a very able man, and far more
liberal than most of his countrymen, is not ashamed to speak of &lsquo;la
justa expulsion de los moriscos desde 1610 á 1613.&rsquo; Ortiz, in 1801,
expresses himself with more hesitation, but is evidently in favour of a
measure which liberated Spain from &lsquo;la perniciosa semilla de Mahoma que
restaba en ella.&rsquo; <i>Compendio de la Historia de España</i>, vol. vi. pp.
304, 305. Nay, even in 1856, the great modern historian of Spain, while
admitting the serious material injury which this horrible crime
inflicted on the country, assures us that it had the &lsquo;immense advantage&rsquo;
of producing religious unity; unable to perceive that the very unity of
which he boasts, generates an acquiescence and stagnation of mind fatal
to all real improvement, because it prevents that play and collision of
opinions by which the wits of men are sharpened and made ready for use,
&lsquo;Con la expulsion se completó el principio de la unidad religiosa en
España, que fué un bien inmenso, pero se consumó la ruina de la
agricultura, que fué un inmenso mal.&rsquo; <i>Lafuente</i>, <i>Historia de España</i>,
vol. xvii. p. 340, Madrid, 1856. And, the year after this sagacious
sentiment had been given to the world, another eminent Spaniard, in a
work crowned by the Royal Academy of History, went still further, and
declared, that not only did the expulsion of the Moriscoes cause great
benefit by securing unity of creed, but that such unity was &lsquo;necessary
on the Spanish soil.&rsquo; &lsquo;Y si bajo el aspecto económico reprobamos
semejante medida por la influencia perniciosa que tuvo desde el momento
de dictarse, la imparcialidad de historiadores nos obliga á respetarla
por los inmensos bienes que produjo en el órden religioso y en el órden
político.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;La unidad religiosa era necesaria en el suelo español.&rsquo;
<i>Janer</i>, <i>Condicion Social de los Moriscos de España</i>, Madrid, 1857, pp.
110, 114. What are we to think of a country in which these opinions are
expressed, not by some obscure fanatic, from the platform or the pulpit,
but by able and learned men, who promulgate them with all the authority
of their position, being themselves deemed, if anything, rather too bold
and too liberal for the people to whom they address their works?</p></div>

á la memoria lo que veian y apenas creian. Enmudeció pues la historia de
España en los dos reynados de Felipe IV. y Carlos II. viendo continuaba
nuestra decadencia, hasta quedar España al nivel de los menos poderosos
Estados de Europa. Este silencio nos ha privado de saber no solo las
causas de nuestra decadencia, sino tambien de los acontecimientos
civiles y militares del siglo xvii.&rsquo; <i>Ortiz</i>, <i>Compendio de la Historia
de España</i>, vol. vi., Prologo, p. i. No attempt was made to supply the
deficiency complained of by Ortiz, until 1856, when M. Lafuente
published, in Madrid, the sixteenth and seventeenth volumes of his
History of Spain, which contain the reigns of Philip IV. and Charles II.
Of this work, I have no desire to speak disrespectfully; on the
contrary, it is impossible to read it without interest, on account of
the admirable clearness with which the different topics are arranged,
and also on account of its beautiful style, which reminds us of the best
days of Castilian prose. But I feel constrained to say, that, as a
history, and especially as a history which undertakes to investigate the
causes of the decline of Spain, it is a complete failure. In the first
place, M. Lafuente has not emancipated himself from those very
prejudices to which the decline of his country is owing. And, in the
second place, he has, particularly in the reigns of Philip IV. and
Charles II., not used sufficient diligence in searching for materials
for studying the economical changes through which Spain has passed.
Looking too intently at the surface, he mistakes symptoms for causes; so
that the real history of the Spanish people every where escapes his
grasp. As the object to which my studies are directed, compels me to
contemplate affairs from a larger and more general point of view than he
has done, it naturally happens that the conclusions at which we arrive
are very different; but I wish to bear my testimony, whatever it may be
worth, to the great merit of his book as a work of art, though, as a
work of science, it appears to me that he has effected nothing, and has
thrown no new light on the real history of that unfortunate, albeit once
splendid, nation, of which his eloquence, his learning, and his taste,
make him one of the chiefest ornaments.</p></div>

imperfect; but, after the desolation of Spain in the seventeenth
century, an extraordinary diminution in the population of the capital
was inevitable. Indeed, a contemporary of Charles II. states that in
1699, Madrid had only 150,000 inhabitants. <i>Mémoires de Louville</i>,

<i>Boisel</i>, <i>Journal du Voyage d'Espagne</i>, Paris, 1669, 4to. p. 186:
&lsquo;Autresfois, cette ville qui paroist assez grande, estoit fort riche,
tant à cause que les rois de Castille y demeuroient, qu'à cause du grand
commerce des laines et des beaux draps qui s'y faisoient; mais à présent
le trafic n'y est plus, et on n'y fait plus que fort peu de draps, de
sorte que la ville est presque désert et fort pauvre. Une marque de sa
pauvreté, du mauvais ordre d'Espagne, et du peu de prévoyance des
Espagnols (quoy qu'on dise de leur flegme), c'est que le jour que j'y
arrivay jusques à deux heures après midy il n'y avoit point eu de pain
en toute la ville, et ils ne s'en étonnoient point.&rsquo; The decline of the
silk and wool manufactures of Segovia is also noticed by Martinez de la
Mata, who wrote in 1650. See his <i>Dos Discursos</i>, edited by Canga,
Madrid, 1794, p. 8. Saint Simon, who was there in 1722, says, &lsquo;A l'égard
de leurs laines, j'en vis les manufactures à Ségovie qui me parurent peu
de chose et fort tombées de leur ancienne réputation.&rsquo; <i>Mémoires du Duc
de Saint Simon</i>, vol. xxxvii. p. 230, Paris, 1841. Segovia used to be
famous for the beautiful colour of its cloth, the dye of which was taken
from a shell-fish found in the West Indies, and is supposed to be the
same as the purpura of the ancients. See a note in <i>Dillon's Spain</i>,
Dublin, 1781, pp. 19, 20.</p></div>

reducida la grandeza de sus tratos, Prior, y Cónsules, y ordenanzas para

marchande, mais depuis peu, elle a presque perdu tout son commerce.&rsquo;
<i>Aarsens de Sommerdyck</i>, <i>Voyage d'Espagne</i>, Paris, 1665, 4to. p. 16. To
me, it certainly appears that facts of this sort have more to do with
the real history of Spain than the details of kings, and treaties, and
battles, which the Spanish historians love to accumulate.</p></div>

alive to all this when it found that no more money could be wrung from
the people. In May 1667, a council of state, convoked by the queen,
reported that &lsquo;quant aux ressources qu'on voudrait tirer de l'Espagne,
sous forme de dons volontaires ou autrement, le conseil estime qu'il est
bien difficile d'imposer aux peuples des charges nouvelles;&rsquo; and in
November of that same year, at another meeting of the council, a memoir
was drawn up, stating that &lsquo;depuis le règne de Don Ferdinand le
Catholique jusqu'à ce jour, la monarchie d'Espagne ne s'est pas encore
vue si près de sa ruine, si épuisée, si dénuée des ressources
nécessaires pour faire face à un grand péril.&rsquo; See extracts from the

by M. Mignet, in his <i>Négociations relatives à la Succession d'Espagne</i>,

work, vol. ii. p. 127, a letter to Louis XIV., from his ambassador at

contemporary witness could make such things credible. In 1686, Alvarez
Osorio y Redin wrote his <i>Discursos</i>. They were published in 1687 and
1688; they were reprinted at Madrid in 1775; and from the reprint, pp.
345&ndash;348, I extract the following particulars: &lsquo;Es preciso decir con la
mayor brevedad, que pide el asunto, en la forma que los comisionantes
continuamente están saqueando todos los lugares, con capa de servir á
V.M. Entran en ellos, intíman sus comisiones á las justicias, y ellas
les suplican, tengan misericordia de los moradores, que estan con mucha
necesidad. Y luego que toman el uso, dicen: que á ellos no les toca
dispensar en hacer gracias: que traen orden de cobrar con todo rigor las
cantidades, que deben los lugares; y tambien dicen han de cobrar sus
salarios. Y se van entrando por las casas de los pobres labradores, y
demás vecinos; y con mucha cuenta y razon, les quitan el poco dinero,
que tienen: y á los que no tienen, les sacan prendas: y donde no las
hallan, les quitan las pobres camas, en que duermen: y se detienen en
vender las prendas, todo el tiempo que pueden.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Los saquéos
referidos van continuando, obligando á los mas vecinos de los lugares, á
que se vayan huyendo de sus casas, dexando baldías sus haciendas de
campo; y los cobradores no tienen lástima de todas estas miserias, y
asolaciones, como si entráran en lugares de enemigos. Las casas, que
hallan vacías, si hay quien se las compre, las venden: y quando no
pueden venderlas, las quitan los texados; y venden la texa, y madera por
qualquier dinero. Con esta destruicion general, no han quedado en pie en
los lugares la tercera parte de casas, y han muerto de necesidad gran
multitud de personas. Con lo qual los lugares no tienen la mitad de
familias, que antiguamente habia en España. Y si no se pone remedio á
todo referido, será preciso, que la vengan á poblar de otros Reynos.&rsquo;</p></div>

1767, folio, I find a letter written by Hopton to Secretary Windebank,
dated Madrid, 31st May, 1635. The author of this official communication
gives an account of the Spanish troops just raised, and says, &lsquo;I have
observed these levies, and I find the horses are so weak, as the most of
them will never be able to go to the rendezvous, and those very hardly
gotten, the infantry so unwilling to serve, as they are carried like
galley-slaves, in chains, which serves not the turn, and so far short of
the number that was proposed, as they come not to one of three.&rsquo; This
was eight years before the battle of Rocroy; after it, matters became
rapidly worse. A letter from Sir Edward Hyde to Secretary Nicholas,
dated Madrid, 18th March, 1649&ndash;50, states, that Spanish &lsquo;affairs are
really in huge disorder, and capable of being rendered almost
desperate;&rsquo; and another letter, on 14th April, 1650, &lsquo;if some miracle do
not preserve them, this crown must be speedily destroyed,&rsquo; <i>Clarendon
State Papers</i>, vol. iii. pp. 13, 17, Oxford, 1786. An official Report on
the Netherlands, presented to Louis XIV. in 1665, declares that the

the war within the next one hundred years.&rsquo; <i>Raumer's History of the

étoient autrefois des lions, ou des véritables hommes et incomparables
en valeur, sont maintenant des cerfs, ou des femmes, et enfin des
personnes peu propres à la guerre.&rsquo; And finally, the Spanish explanation
of all this in <i>Yañez</i>, <i>Memorias</i>, Prologo, pp. 148, 149, Madrid, 1723.
&lsquo;La Monarquia de España, cuya decadencia la avia yá Dios decretado desde

land; her ordinary naval force was 140 galleys, which were the terror
both of the Mediterranean and Atlantic. But now&rsquo; (1656), &lsquo;in consequence
of the decline of commerce and fisheries on the coast, instead of the
numerous squadrons of the Dorias and Mendozas, which were wont to attend
the movements of the first great John of Austria and the Emperor
Charles, the present High-Admiral of Spain, and favourite son of its
monarch, put to sea with three wretched gallies, which, with difficulty,
escaped from some Algerine corsairs, and were afterwards nearly
shipwrecked on the coast of Africa.&rsquo; <i>Dunlop's Memoirs</i>, vol. i. p. 549.
In 1663, &lsquo;Il n'y avait à Cadix ni vaisseaux ni galères en état d'aller
en mer. Les Maures insultaient audacieusement les côtes de l'Andalousie,
et prenaient impunément les barques qui se hasardaient à une lieue de la
rade. Le duc d'Albuquerque, qui commandait les forces navales, se
plaignait hautement de la position humiliante dans laquelle on le
laissait. Il avait demandé avec instance qu'on lui donnât des matelots
et des soldats pour mettre sur les vaisseaux; mais le Comte de
Castrillo, président du Conseil de Finances (de la <i>hacienda</i>) avait
déclaré qu'il n'avait ni argent, ni la possibilité d'en trouver, et
conseillait de renoncer à l'armée navale.&rsquo; <i>Mignet</i>, <i>Négociations

feeble in point of naval affairs as to be obliged to hire Dutch vessels
for carrying on her American commerce.&rsquo; <i>Macpherson's Annals of
Commerce</i>, vol. ii. p. 435, London, 1805, 4to. And, to complete the
chain of evidence, there is a letter in the <i>Clarendon State Papers</i>,
vol. ii. p. 86, Oxford, 1773, folio, written from Madrid in June 1640,
stating that, &lsquo;For ships they have few, mariners fewer, landsmen not so
many as they need, and, by all signs, money not at all that can be
spared.&rsquo; The history of Spain during this period never having been
written, I am compelled, in my own justification, to give these and
similar passages with a fulness which I fear will weary some readers.</p></div>

having had the benefit of a Spanish education, should be enlightened on
the subject of the Inquisition. He was, therefore, informed, &lsquo;que la
pureza de la religion Catolica en estos reynos se debia á la vigilancia
de la Inquisicion y sus ministros, todos justos, clementes y
circunspectos, no rigidos, violentos ni crueles, como por error ó
malicia los pintan comunmente los Franceses. Y que <i>la conservacion de

(<i>Comentarios</i>, vol. ii. pp. 122&ndash;125) gives an interesting account of
the attacks made on the rights of the Church, and which, he says, p.
122, were &lsquo;poco ajustados á la doctrina de los Santos Padres, á la
Inmunidad de la Iglesia, y que sonaban á heregía.&rsquo; He significantly
adds, p. 125, &lsquo;Los pueblos de España, que son tan religiosos, y
professan la mayor veneracion á la Iglesia, creían que esta se
atropellaba, <i>y huvo alguna interna inquietud, no sin fomento de los
adversos al Rey, cuyo puro, y sincero corazon podia ser engañado</i>; pero
no inducido á un evidente error contra los Sagrados Canones,&rsquo; &amp;c. Such

influential work on commerce which the reign of Philip V. produced, I
find the following instructive passage: &lsquo;Aunque en los Puertos de las

hace comercio muy considerable, y util por diversas naciones, no podrá
España tener gran parte en él, mientras se observare la maxima de hacer

mayor parte de aquellas Provincias; sin embargo de ser constante, que
<i>en esta guerra, aunque procedida de zelo Christiano, es mayor el daño
que recibimos, que el que ocasionamos á los Infieles</i>&rsquo; (the way the
mercantile spirit peeps out here, is extremely curious) &lsquo;á lo menos de
muchos años á esta parte, como lo he explicado en diversos capitulos.&rsquo;
<i>Uztariz</i>, <i>Theorica y Practica de Comercio</i>, Madrid, 1757, p. 399. This
is the third edition of a book, which, considering the circumstances

Alberoni, finding himself in great peril, took advantage of the secrecy
of the negotiations, to deny part, at least, of the charges made against
him. See his indignant, but yet cautious, letter to the Pope, in

into the evidence, is so ill-informed as to suppose that this was a
calumnious accusation brought against Alberoni after his fall. &lsquo;Caido ya

travelled through Spain with the express object of noting the state of
knowledge, as well as the economical condition of the country, and who,
by previous study, had well qualified himself for such an undertaking,
says, &lsquo;I have observed in general, that the physicians with whom I have
had occasion to converse, are disciples of their favourite doctor
Piquer, who denied, or at least doubted of, the circulation of the
blood.&rsquo; <i>Townsend's Journey through Spain</i>, 2d ed., London, 1792, vol.
iii. p. 281. At that time, the Spanish physicians were, however,
beginning to read Hoffmann, Cullen, and other heretical speculators, in
whose works they would find, to their astonishment, that the circulation
of the blood was assumed, and was not even treated as a debatable
question. But the students were obliged to take such matters on trust;
for, adds Townsend, p. 282, &lsquo;In their medical classes, they had no
dissections.&rsquo; Compare <i>Laborde's Spain</i>, vol. i. p. 76, vol. iii. p.
315, London, 1809, and <i>Godoy's Memoirs</i>, London, 1836, vol. ii. p. 157.
Godoy, speaking of the three colleges of surgery at Madrid, Barcelona,
and Cadiz, says that until his administration in 1793, &lsquo;In the capital,
even that of San Carlos had not a lecture-room for practical
instruction.&rsquo;</p></div>

<i>Elogio de Carlos III.</i>, Madrid, 1789, 4to. p. xiv. &lsquo;La salubridad del
ayre, la limpieza y seguridad de las calles,&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Pero ¿quién creerá
que este noble empeño produxo las mas vivas quejas: que se conmovió el
vulgo de todas clases; y que tuvo varias autoridades á su favor la
extraña doctrina de que los vapores mefiticos eran un correctivo
saludable de la rigidez del clima?&rsquo; But the fullest detail will be found
in the recently published and very elaborate History of Charles III. by
M. Rio, from which I will give one or two extracts. &lsquo;Para la limpieza de
las calles poseia mayores ó menores fondos el ayuntamiento, y cuando el
Rey quiso poner la mano en este ramo de policía, le presentaron
dictámenes de médicos en que se defendia el absurdo de ser elemento de
salubridad la basura.&rsquo; <i>Rio</i>, <i>Historia del Reinado de Carlos III.</i>,
Madrid, 1856, vol. iv. p. 54. See also vol. i. pp. 267, 268, where it is
mentioned, that when the minister, Esquilache, persevered in his
attempts to have the streets of Madrid cleaned, the opponents of the
scheme made inquiries into the opinions of their fathers on that
subject; and the result was, &lsquo;que le presentaron cierta originalísima
consulta hecha por los médicos bajo el reinado de uno de los Felipes de
Austria, y reducida á demostrar que, siendo sumamente sutil el aire de
la poblacion á causa de estar próxima la sierra de Guadarrama,
ocasionaria los mayores estragos si no se impregnara en los vapores de
las inmundicias desparramadas por las calles.&rsquo; That this idea had long
been entertained by the physicians of Madrid, we also know from another
testimony, with which none of the Spanish historians are acquainted. Sir
Richard Wynne, who visited that capital in 1623, describes a disgusting
practice of the inhabitants, and adds, &lsquo;Being desirous to know why so
beastly a custom is suffered, they say it's a thing prescribed by their
physicians; for they hold the air to be so piercing and subtle, that
this kind of corrupting it with these ill vapours keeps it in good
temper.&rsquo; <i>The Autobiography and Correspondence of Sir Simonds D'Ewes</i>,

evidence in <i>Townsend's Journey through Spain in 1786 and 1787</i>, vol.
ii. pp. 37&ndash;39. Townsend, who had some knowledge of medicine, was amazed
at the ignorance and recklessness of the Spanish physicians. He says,
&lsquo;The science and practice of medicine are at the lowest ebb in Spain,
but more especially in the Asturias.&rsquo; Compare <i>Sprengel</i>, <i>Histoire de
la Médecine</i>, vol. iii. p. 217, Paris, 1815, with <i>Winwood's Memorials</i>,

terrible &lsquo;purging and letting blood,&rsquo; to which the unfortunate Spaniards
were exposed in the reign of Philip III. Another observer, much later,
states that &lsquo;La saignée leur est assez familière. Ils se la font faire
hors du lit tant que leurs forces le permettent, et <i>lorsqu'ils en usent
par précaution, ils se font tirer du sang deux jours de suite du bras

began to admit this; since they could not shut their eyes to the fact
that their friends and relations succumbed so rapidly under professional
treatment, that sickness and death were almost synonymous. Hence,
notwithstanding their hatred of the French nation, they availed
themselves of the services of French physicians and French surgeons,
whenever they had an opportunity of doing so. In 1707, the Princess des
Ursins writes from Madrid to Madame de Maintenon, &lsquo;Les chirurgiens
espagnols sont mésestimés même de ceux de leur nation;&rsquo; and, in another
letter, &lsquo;Les Espagnols conviennent que les médecins français sont
beaucoup plus savants que les leurs; ils s'en servent même

Switzerland, and afterwards at the Hague (<i>Ripperda's Memoirs</i>, 1740,
pp. 37, 38); and that in, or just before, 1779, Lacy filled the same
post at St. Petersburg. <i>Malmesbury's Diaries and Correspondence</i>, 1844,
vol. i. p. 261. So, too, M. Rio (<i>Historia de Carlos III.</i>, vol. i. pp.
288, 289) says of the important negotiations which took place in 1761,
between Spain, England, and France, &lsquo;Y así de las negociaciones en que
Luis XV. trataba de enredar á Carlos III. quedaron absolutamente
excluidos los españoles, como que por una parte las iban á seguir el
duque de Choiseul y el marques de Ossun, franceses, y por otra el
irlandés D. Ricardo Wall, y el genovés marques de Grimaldi.&rsquo; About the
same time, Clarke writes (in his <i>Letters concerning the Spanish
Nation</i>, London, 1763, 4to. p. 331), &lsquo;Spain has, for many years past,
been under the direction of foreign ministers. Whether this hath been
owing to want of capacity in the natives, or disinclination in the
sovereign, I will not take upon me to say; such as it is, the native
nobility lament it as a great calamity.&rsquo;</p></div>

anecdote from a person connected with the encyclopædists. During his
residence in that capital, D'Aranda had frequently testified to the
literati with whom he associated, his resolution to obtain the abolition
of the Inquisition, should he ever be called to power. His appointment
was, therefore, exultingly hailed by the party, particularly by
D'Alembert; and he had scarcely begun his reforms before an article was
inserted in the Encyclopædia, then printing, in which this event was
confidently anticipated, from the liberal principles of the minister.
D'Aranda was struck on reading this article, and said, &ldquo;This imprudent
disclosure will raise such a ferment against me, that my plans will be
foiled.&rdquo; He was not mistaken in his conjecture.&rsquo; <i>Coxe&lsquo;s Bourbon Kings

home-produce quintupled; and the returns from America augmented in the

the constitutional stone, and uttered the most atrocious insults against

overthrow their own liberties, as a Spanish historian truly remarks. &lsquo;Il
n'est pas étonnant que les monarques espagnols tâchassent d'affermir
leur autorité autant que possible, et encore moins que leurs conseillers
et leurs, ministres coopérassent à leurs desseins. L'histoire de toutes
les nations nous offre de nombreux exemples de cette politique; mais <i>ce
qu'il y a de plus remarquable dans celle d'Espagne, c'est que les
députés des villes qui auraient dû être les plus zélés défenseurs de
leurs droits, conspirèrent ouvertement contre le tiers-état</i>, et
tentèrent d'anéantir les restes de l'ancienne représentation nationale.&rsquo;
<i>Sempere</i>, <i>Histoire des Cortès d'Espagne</i>, p. 213. It strikes one as
singular, that M. Sempere should never have inquired, why this happened
in Spain, and not elsewhere. A later writer, reflecting on the
destruction of the municipal element by the royal authority, gives a
solution, which, like many other so-called solutions, is merely a
statement of the same fact in different words. &lsquo;Al fin la autoridad real
logró alcanzar un gran predominio en el gobierno municipal de los
pueblos, <i>porque</i> los corregidores y alcaldes mayores llegaron á
eclipsar la influencia de los adelantados y alcaldes elegidos por los
pueblos.&rsquo; <i>Antequera</i>, <i>Historia de la Legislacion Española</i>, Madrid,
1849, p. 287. This, instead of explaining the event, is simply narrating
it afresh.</p></div>

many writers to the battle of Villalar, in 1521; though it is quite
certain that, if the royalists had lost that battle, instead of gaining
it, the ultimate result would have been the same. At one time, I had
purposed tracing the history of the municipal and representative
elements during the fifteenth century; and the materials which I then
collected, convinced me that the spirit of freedom never really existed
in Spain, and that therefore the marks and forms of freedom were sure,
sooner or later, to be effaced.</p></div>

(<i>Histoire de la Compagnie de Jésus</i>, vol. v. p. 311) and other writers
(<i>Dunham's History of Spain</i>, vol. v. p. 180), has been much
misrepresented, and has even been doubted by one author, I will
transcribe the statement of Coxe, whose information respecting the reign
of Charles III. was derived from eye-witnesses. &lsquo;A remarkable and
alarming proof of their influence was given at Madrid, the year after
their expulsion. At the festival of St. Charles, when the monarch showed
himself to the people from the balcony of the palace, and was accustomed
to grant their general request; to the surprise and confusion of the
whole court, the voice of the immense multitude, with one accord,
demanded the return of the Jesuits, and the permission for them to wear
the habit of the secular clergy. This unexpected incident alarmed and
mortified the King; and, after a vigilant inquiry, he thought proper to
banish the Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo, and his Grand Vicar, as the
secret instigators of this tumultuary petition.&rsquo; <i>Coxe's Bourbon Kings
of Spain</i>, 2nd edit., London, 1815, vol. iv. pp. 368, 369. The remarks
made on this event by M. Rio (<i>Historia del Reinado de Carlos III.</i>,
Madrid, 1856, vol. ii. pp. 197&ndash;199) are not very creditable, either to
his criticism or to his candour. It is uncritical to doubt the statement
of a contemporary, when that statement relates what is probable in
itself, and what those who lived nearest to the period never denied.
Indeed, so far from denying it, M. Muriel, the learned translator of
Coxe's work into Spanish, gave it the sanction of his name. And, it is
surely, to say the least, very uncandid on the part of M. Rio to impute
to Coxe the error of placing this occurrence in 1767, and then proving
that, owing to circumstances connected with the Archbishop of Toledo, it
could not have happened in that year. For, Coxe distinctly asserts, that
it was in 1768; &lsquo;the year <i>after</i> their expulsion.&rsquo;</p></div>

Uztariz could pen a sentence like this, we may imagine what was felt by
the people, who were far more ignorant than he, and far more orthodox.
M. Tapia, in a remarkable and unusually bold passage, frankly admits
that it was the pressure of public opinion which prevented Charles III.
from abolishing the Inquisition. &lsquo;Estraño pareceria que habiéndose hecho
tanto en aquel reinado para limitar el poder escesivo del clero, y
acabar con absurdas preocupaciones, no se suprimiese el monstruoso
tribunal de la inquisicion; pero es necesario tener presente que el rey
despues del motin de Madrid procedia con timidez en toda providencia que
pudiese contrariar la opinion pública; y él creia que los españoles
querian la inquisicion, como se lo manifestó al ministro Roda y al conde
de Aranda, añadiendo que en nada coartaba su autoridad.&rsquo; <i>Tapia</i>,
<i>Civilizacion Española</i>, vol. iv. p. 98, Madrid, 1840. To us, the
Inquisition seems rather a singular object for men to set their
affections on; but of the existence of the passion there can be no
doubt. &lsquo;L'Inquisition si révérée en Espagne.&rsquo; <i>Mémoires de Louville</i>,
vol. i. p. 36. And Geddes (<i>Tracts</i>, London, 1730, vol. i. p. 400) tells
us that &lsquo;the Inquisition is not only established by law, but by a
wonderful fascination is so fixed in the hearts and affections of the
people, that one that should offer the least affront to another, for
having been an informer or witness in the Inquisition, would be torn in
a thousand pieces.&rsquo;</p></div>

ignorant, it is impossible to dissemble; but this comes from the control
of education being altogether in the hands of the clergy, who exert
themselves to maintain that ignorance to which they are indebted for
their power.&rsquo; <i>Spain by an American</i>, vol. ii. p. 360. &lsquo;The schools in

all countries, Catholic or Protestant, the clergy, considered as a body,
inculcate belief instead of inquiry, and, by a sort of conservative
instinct, discourage that boldness of investigation without which there
can be no real knowledge, although there may be much erudition and mere
book-learning. In Spain, the clergy are stronger than in any other
country; therefore in Spain they display this tendency more fearlessly.
A good instance of this may be seen in a work lately published by the
Bishop of Barcelona, in which a violent attack upon all physical and
philosophical knowledge is concluded in the following terms: &lsquo;No intento
recriminar á ningun católico de los que se asocian al nuevo sistema de
filosofar y de extender indefinidamente el imperio de esta ciencia, pero
deseo que fijen toda su atencion en los puntos que no haré sino indicar.
Primero, que las escuelas de Holanda, Alemania, Inglaterra y Francia
desafectas al Catolicismo, han iniciado y promovido con el mayor empeño
ciertas discusiones filosóficas, presentándolas como un triunfo de la
razon sobre la Religion, de la filosofía sobre la teología, del
materialismo sobre el espiritualismo. Segundo, que sus máximas no son,
en gran parte, mas que reproducciones ó nuevas evoluciones de errores
mil veces refutados y condenados por la sana filosofía y por la Iglesia;
bajo cuyo concepto no tienen por qué felicitarse en razon de su
progreso, sino mas bien avergonzarse por su retroceso.&rsquo; <i>Costa y
Borras</i>, <i>Iglesia en España</i>, Barcelona, 1857, p. 150.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1522_1522" id="Footnote_1522_1522"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1522_1522"><span class="label">[1522]</span></a> &lsquo;Immediately after his arrival in Madrid, Ferdinand
re-established the Inquisition; and his decree for that purpose was
hailed throughout all Spain with illuminations, thanksgivings, and other
rejoicings. &rsquo;<i>Quin's Memoirs of Ferdinand VII.</i>, London, 1824, pp. 189,
190. This and similar acts gave such delight to the Church as well as to
the people, that, according to a great divine, the return of Ferdinand
to Spain is to be deemed the immediate act of Divine Providence,
watching over the interests of Spain. &lsquo;La divina Providencia abrevió los
dias de prueba, y la católica España respiró ceñida con los laureles del
triunfo, recobrando luego á su tan deseado monarca, el señor rey don
Fernando VII.&rsquo; <i>Costa y Borras</i>, <i>Observaciones sobre la Iglesia en
España</i>, Barcelona, 1857, p. 91.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1523_1523" id="Footnote_1523_1523"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1523_1523"><span class="label">[1523]</span></a> &lsquo;The spirit of the Inquisition is still alive; for no
king, cortes, or constitution, ever permits in Spain any approach to any
religious toleration.&rsquo; <i>Ford's Spain</i>, London, 1847, p. 60. &lsquo;Les cortès
auraient beau permettre l'exercice du culte protestant ou juif, il n'est
point certain que cela ne suscitât de périlleux conflits.&rsquo; <i>Annuaire des
Deux Mondes</i>, <i>ou Histoire Générale des Divers Etats</i>, 1854&ndash;1855, vol.
v. p. 272, Paris, 1855; a work of considerable ability, planned on the
same scheme as the <i>Annual Register</i>, but far superior to it. Respecting
the chance of the Inquisition being again restored, compare two
interesting passages in <i>Spain by an American</i>, 1831, vol. ii. p. 330,
and <i>Inglis' Spain</i>, 1831, vol. i. p. 85. Since then, the balance of
affairs has, on the whole, been in favour of the Church, which received
a further accession of strength by the success of the essentially
religious war recently waged against the Moors. Hence, if any fresh
political catastrophe were to occur in Spain, I should not be at all
surprised to hear that the Inquisition was re-established.</p></div>

orders, &lsquo;Le respect pour le froc en général est poussé si loin, qu'on
lui attribue une vertu préservative, même au-delà de la vie, quelque peu
régulière qu'elle ait été. Aussi n'y a-t-il rien de si commun que de
voir les morts ensevelis en robe de moines, et conduits ainsi à leur
dernière demeure à visage découvert.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;De même
que le froc accompagne les Espagnols au tombeau, de même il en saisit
quelques-uns au sortir du berceau. Il n'est pas rare de rencontrer de
petits moines de quatre à cinq ans polissonnant dans la rue.&rsquo;

Hoskins, the well-known traveller in Africa, a gentleman evidently of
considerable intelligence, published, on his return from Spain, an
account of that country. His work is valuable, as showing the state of
public feeling just before the Concordat, and while the Spanish clergy
were still suffering from the well-intentioned, but grossly injudicious
acts of the liberal party. &lsquo;We visited these churches on a Sunday, and
were surprised to find them all crowded to excess. The incomes of the
clergy are greatly reduced, but their fortunes are gradually reviving.&rsquo;
<i>Hoskins' Spain</i>, London, 1851, vol. i. p. 25. &lsquo;The priests are slowly
re-establishing their power in Spain,&rsquo; vol. ii. p. 201. &lsquo;The crowded
churches, and, notwithstanding the appropriation of their revenues, the
absence of all appearance of anything like poverty in the chapels and
services, prove that the Spaniards are now as devout worshippers, and as
zealous friends of the Church, as they were in her palmy days,&rsquo; vol. ii.
